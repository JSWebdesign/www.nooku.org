            <h2>What is Nooku Platform?</h2>
            <p>Nooku Platform was <a href="http://www.nooku.org/blog/2010/12/nooku-server-joomla-on-steroids/">born at the end of 2010</a>  with the goal to create a <a href="http://www.nooku.org/blog/2011/01/creating-a-diet-for-nooku-server/">leaner</a> and <a href="http://www.nooku.org/blog/2011/01/nooku-server-loses-40-weight/">meaner</a> multi-site and multi-lingual distro of <a href="http://www.joomla.org">Joomla</a> 1.5 for the <a href="http://www.openpolice.be">Belgian Police</a>. Originally named Nooku Server and renamed to Nooku Platform in 2014.</p>
            <p>With the end of life of Joomla 1.5 end of 2012 compatibility with Joomla was dropped and development continued in an effort to completely refactor the code base to a modern and lean architecture using well-established coding standards and best practices.</p>
            <p>At the moment Nooku Platform is at version 0.9 and work is ongoing to remove the last bits of Joomla legacy code. Once this work is completed a 1.0 alpha release will be made available.</p>
