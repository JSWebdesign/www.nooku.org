How time flies &#8230; Nooku is [one year old][1] today! It has been an great year for Nooku with [great][2] and [encouraging][3] feedback. Our [partner base][4] grew to more then 20 partners in the past year.Â  Their enthusiasm and commitment shows that a funded GPL model can be a great way to build highly advanced Joomla extensions.

Our [agile development methodology][5] has allowed us to release early and often. In the past 12 months we released 2 feature releases and a total of 10 maintenance releases. We counted more than 1500 code commits, closed over 100 tickets and saw a codebase increase of more then 40%. Nooku Content is slowly evolving into a real content manager, and is not just for publishing multi-lingual websites anymore. Mono-lingual websites can benefit from the workflow and [search engine optimization features][6] Nooku offers as well.

And there is more to come: for the next versions we are focusing on advanced user and translator permissions, article versioning and user interface changes to make your life as a content editor even easier. Our goal is to make Nooku Content the de-facto extension every professional Joomla site should have installed. The coming year we are boosting things up even more, and we&#8217;ll be sticking to [our promise][7] of making the technology available to more people.

I would like to take this opportunity to thank all our partners for being so supportive to our project. Without their vision and support we wouldn&#8217;t be where we are today: on the verge of a [Nooku Framework][8] technology explosion. We are extremely excited about the work done in the last 12 months. It&#8217;s the tip of the iceberg of what&#8217;s to come.
