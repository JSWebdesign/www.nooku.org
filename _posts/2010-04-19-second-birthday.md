This week, it&#8217;s exactly two years since we launched the Nooku.org website. We have been working behind the scenes for a long time, so it feels great to finally be able to show the world what we were doing. So it is with great pride that on Nooku&#8217;s second birthday, we&#8217;re announcing our <a id="pbm6" title="rand new site" href="http://nooku.org/">brand new site</a>.

### Innovation through extensions

<img class="alignleft" title="The Nooku Train" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4031/4536195092_9407942e60_m.jpg" alt="" width="240" height="166" />Let&#8217;s face it: there has been a lot of uncertainty in the Joomlasphere. Joomla 1.6 is the center of attention, but progresses slowly. Because of that, some people are considering to move away from Joomla.

We believe the naysayers are looking in the wrong direction. The Joomla core is just a piece of the puzzle. The community is **driving innovation through amazing extensions**. The Nooku platform is a game-changing technology that creates new momentum. Joomla Co-founder Peter Russell calls it

### New website and resources

If you have been following closely, you may have noticed that **Nooku HQ was buzzing with activity**: earlier this month, we launched the new <a id="cm9:" title="Nooku Developer Portal" href="http://code.nooku.org/">Nooku Developer Portal</a>, invited you to  the <a id="y.m4" title="community maintained wiki" href="http://wiki.nooku.org/">community maintained wiki</a>, and opened the <a id="k2.t" title="Nooku Framework mailing list" href="http://lists.nooku.org/">Nooku Framework mailing list</a> to the public. The new <a id="rakx" title="Nooku.org" href="http://nooku.org/">Nooku.org</a> main site has a better structure to help you find your way through our resources, and makes a **clear distinction between Nooku Content **(the multi-lingual extension) **and Nooku Framework**, the new brain for Joomla.

### <!--more-->Blossoming community

Two years ago, we were not much more than a handful of people with a vision. Today, Nooku is:

*   an active team of 8 people
*   <a id="as3c" title="18 partners" href="http://nooku.org/partners.html">18 partners</a> from enterprises, governmental organisations, and non-profits
*   300 subscribers in the developer&#8217;s <a id="wtrh" title="discussion group" href="http://lists.nooku.org/">discussion group</a>
*   hundreds of websites powered by Nooku Content and Nooku Framework

We&#8217;ve been out there a lot as well:

*   We presented Nooku on 8 Joomladays in Europe and one in Asia
*   We co-organized 3 Nooku Code Jams with our partners
*   We spoke on 3 Nooku Demo Days

Code metrics are not a good measurement for the size or quality of a project, but they do help to <a id="xiwj" title="indicate progress" href="http://www.ohloh.net/p/nooku-framework">indicate progress</a>. In our official repositories, we have:

*   1900 commits for Nooku Framework
*   1100 commits for Nooku Content
*   450 commits for Nooku Components
*   12 contributing Nooku Rock Stars

### Open Source drives innovation

We love Joomla and we want it to thrive. We want Joomla to have a future, not just a history. Nooku can make this happen. We recognize that **for some, change is difficult**. But this is technology! It&#8217;s the fastest game in the world! As long time Joomla community member, and <a id="pdom" title="Nooku Rock Star Torkil Johnsen said" href="http://groups.google.com/group/joomla-dev-cms/browse_thread/thread/a477a550bb051f29?tvc=2&">Nooku Rock Star Torkil Johnsen said</a>:

> &#8220;You have to chase and embrace innovation to stay in the game, not demand that it comes over to shine your shoes.&#8221;
