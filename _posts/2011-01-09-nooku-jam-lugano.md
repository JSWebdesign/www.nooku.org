Together with our friends from [Beyounic][1] we are organising the first Nooku Jam of 2011 in beautiful city of Lugano, Switzerland on the **19th of January 2011**. The [University of Lugano][2] has kindly offered to host the jam on their campus.

[ Nooku Framework][3] is considered by many as one of the most interesting developments in the Joomlasphere of the last two years. Not only because of the **spectacular code reduction** (up to 80%), but also for the many features that were previously unavailable to Joomla and PHP developers:

*   Near-zero-code HMVC
*   REST architecture
*   Object Relational Mapping
*   Out of the box security features
*   Extensibility through CoC, DI, Mixins …
*   Extreme re-usability

If you are a Joomla or PHP developer looking to learn how to build better Joomla extensions faster you don’t want to miss this. Thanks to our sponsors the event is completely free. Don&#8217;t wait and [register now][4]!

### What can you expect?

A Nooku Jam is very much a hands-on event. It&#8221;s a “participatory [unconference][5]”. The idea is that everyone who comes takes part in some way: that might be running a session, taking photos, blogging, tweeting etc. So don&#8217;t forget to bring your laptop, camera, questions, ideas, and if you want you can prepare a small presentation yourself.

### Can’t make it?

Don’t worry, we’re planning more Jams in the near future. In the mean time, if you want to get your hands dirty you check out our public SVN which is available through the Nooku Developer Portal at [http://code.nooku.org][6] For more info on getting started make sure to check out the getting Started information on our [wiki][7].

### Organizing your own jam?

Organize a Nooku Jam yourself? All you need is a venue that can hold about 15 – 25 people (and if possible an extra room for breakout sessions), wifi and a projector.  [Get in touch][8] for more information.
