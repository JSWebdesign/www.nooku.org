<a href="http://blog.hummerbie.com/nooku-nooku-multilanguage-joomla-sites/" target="_blank">Hummerbie</a>, after seeing Nooku Content in action at the [Dutch Joomla conference][1], was so impressed he wrote <a href="http://blog.hummerbie.com/nooku-nooku-multilanguage-joomla-sites/" target="_blank">an elaborate post</a> about it on his Joomla SEO blog:

> &#8220;Hold on, I can hear you think, what about the language specific URLs? Strange formed URLs, Not translated Titles, not translated Meta-tags like descriptions, keywords etc etc…
> 
> Now this is where Johan and Mathias really impressed me!
> 
> (&#8230;) The title that was translated was indeed translated also in the HTML Title, but also the URL itself was automatically rewritten to that language title version.  
> You also get the possibility to translate your meta tag description and keywords into the translated version… so you really get a translated version of a content page in a really Search Engine Optimized way.&#8221;
