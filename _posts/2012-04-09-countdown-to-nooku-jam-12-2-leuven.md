  Share and collaborate
</h3>

<p>
  A Nooku Jam is an open, participatory workshop-event, whose content is provided by participants. The concept is very similar to a <a href="http://barcamp.org/w/page/405173/TheRulesOfBarCamp">barcamp</a>. It is an intense event with discussions, demos and interaction from the attendees.
</p>

<h3 dir="ltr">
  No spectators, only participants.
</h3>

<p>
  Attendees must give a demo, a session, or help with one, or otherwise volunteer / contribute in some way to support the event. Participants won&#8217;t need to decide what to talk about until they get there. All presentations are scheduled the day they happen.
</p>

<h3 dir="ltr">
  All about community
</h3>

<p>
  Anyone with something to contribute or with the desire to learn is welcome and invited to join a Nooku Jam. When you come, be prepared to share with other attendees. When you leave, be prepared to share it with the world.
