It could be argued that we&#8217;re bragging about our baby but we&#8217;re confident it will be a show stealer once it hits the GPL world prime time.   For the time being, Nooku will only be available to our [partner / funders][1], while we&#8217;re perfecting our localization masterpiece.

We&#8217;re looking forward to [hearing from our international friends][2].  We hope you share in the anticipation and excitement, as we believe Nooku Content will be a milestone release that will set the translation community afire.
