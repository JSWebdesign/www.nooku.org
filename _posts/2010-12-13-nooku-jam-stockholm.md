Nooku joined forces with the [The Swedish Joomla! User Association][1] to bring the first Nooku Jam to Stockholm on the **5th of February 2011**. The [ ][2][Swedish Media Association][2] has kindly offered their venue to host the jam. With two main rooms and multiple smaller break out rooms the venue really breaths creativity and can easily host **50 participants**. Ideal for a Nooku Jam!

[ Nooku Framework][3] is considered by many as one of the most interesting developments in the Joomlasphere of the last year. Not only because of the **spectacular code reduction** (up to 80%), but also for the many features that were previously unavailable to Joomla developers:

*   Near-zero-code HMVC
*   REST support
*   Object Relational Mapping
*   Out of the box security features
*   Extensibility through CoC, DI, Mixins …
*   Extreme re-usability

If you are a Joomla or PHP developer looking to learn how to build better Joomla extensions faster you don’t want to miss this. To cover our expenses for food and drinks we are asking a very small entrance fee. Don&#8217;t wait and [register now][4]!

### What can you expect?

A Nooku Jam is very much a hands-on event. It&#8221;s a “participatory [unconference][5]”. The idea is that everyone who comes takes part in some way: that might be running a session, taking photos, blogging, tweeting etc. So don&#8217;t forget to bring your laptop, camera, questions, ideas, and if you want you can prepare a small presentation yourself.

### Can’t make it?

Don’t worry, we’re planning more Jams in the near future. In the mean time, if you want to get your hands dirty you check out our public SVN which is available through the Nooku Developer Portal at [http://code.nooku.org][6] For more info on getting started make sure to check out the getting Started information on our [wiki][7].

### Organizing your own jam?

Organize a Nooku Jam yourself? All you need is a venue that can hold about 15 – 25 people (and if possible an extra room for breakout sessions), wifi and a projector.  [Get in touch][8] for more information.
