Nooku will take part in the biggest international Joomla event of the year. We are kicking it off with an awesome <a href="http://nooku-party.eventbrite.com/" target="_blank">pre-event Nooku party</a>! The 5th of May will definitely be a night to remember. Registrations for dinner are closed but feel free to come and join us at the bar for some drinks or hit the slopes.

The JAB11 <a href="http://jandbeyond.org/programme.html" target="_blank">programme</a> has been Nooku-fied with four presentations from Johan, Stian, Tom, Gergo and Ercan.

### How to Build Native Web Apps with HTML5 and CSS3

HTML and CSS have been quite nice for laying out documents but not so great for web app user interfaces. CSS3 includes a new module called the <a href="http://www.html5rocks.com/tutorials/flexbox/quick/" target="_blank">&#8216;Flexible Box Model&#8217;</a> (aka Flexbox), which makes laying out user interfaces a far easier process.

**Who:** Designers who want to take Joomla and their skill-set to a next level  
**When:** **Friday at 11:15 in Aula Minor**

### Nooku Showcase &#8211; A look into Nooku

More and more Joomla developers are starting to use [Nooku Framework][2]. The first generation of extensions are being released, so JAB is the ideal time to introduce them to the world: Ninjaboard, Ohanah, Anahita, Akeeba Subscriptions, …

We will also demonstrate a couple of custom projects build using Nooku Server and Nooku Desktop. See Nooku in action, and find out what all the fuzz is about in this showcase!

**Who:** Anybody who wants to see some workable Nooku magic  
**When:** **Friday at 11:15 in Aula Minor**

### Nooku Workshop

Saturday will be Nooku Day, we have two sessions back to back which we are transforming into one big workshop session.

#### 1.  From Vision to Architecture

In the first part of the workshop Johan will dive into the intricacies of the Nooku, and talk about the road travelled in the past 3 years from the initial vision to the architecture today.

This session is an ideal introduction into the Nooku Architecture with topics like : REST, HMVC, SOA, SOLID, ROA, GRASP, DI, …

Want to learn about the Nooku magic and understand how to Nooku-fy your own extensions and projects, don’t miss this session!

#### 2. Extension Development

In the second part of the workshop we will continue where we left off @jab10. Together we will build a fully working Joomla extension with version, tagging and logging support.

We will explore how you can make full use of Nooku’s re-usability, flexibility and extendability. Show how to use the HMVC to mash-up components with one line of code and finally we will demonstrate our brand-new REST architecture.

Caution though, we are diving deep into the deeper layers of Nooku&#8217;s API. So come prepared!

**Who:** Developers, hackers, enthusiasts, anyone with a passion for development  
**When:** **Saturday at 15:45 to 18:00 in Aula Minor**
