    It’s almost time for the Joomla highlight of the year, the <a href="http://www.joomladagen.nl/">Dutch Joomladays</a>! This year they are taking place on the 2th and 3th of April at <a href="http://www.kaapdoorn.nl/">Kaapdoorn</a>, near <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&source=s_q&hl=en&geocode=&q=utrecht&aq=&sll=37.0625,-95.677068&sspn=64.792576,93.076172&ie=UTF8&hq=&hnear=Utrecht,+The+Netherlands&t=h&ll=52.093851,5.110703&spn=0.200591,0.363579&z=12">Utrecht</a>.

    The Joomladay in the Netherlands is the oldest and one of the most popular Joomla events in Europe: two days, hundreds of attendees, and lots of parallel sessions. Traditionally it has a great mix of newbies, organizations, and community members, which is the perfect recipe for inspiring discoveries.

  <h3>
    Nooku Extensions, a look under the hood
  </h3>
  
  <p>
    Coding with Nooku Framework is fun! In this presentation we will take you to the Disneyland of code. Together we will dive under the hood of Nooku and show the magic in action.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    In 30 minutes and 10 slides and just a few lines of code we will build a complete component with tagging, trash and version management, logging, splitviews … Don’t believe it? <a href="http://www.joomladagen.nl/2011/programma/presentaties/593-nooku-extensies-bouwen-een-kijkje-onder-motorkap">Come, see and experience the magic</a>.

  <h3>
    Nooku Platform, platform and framework
  </h3>
  
  <p>
    We are moving to a world dominated by web apps, instead of web sites. Tablets and other mobile devices are changing our world and the way we build web applications.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Exciting challenges lie ahead. What we need is a platform that allows developers to quickly build ‘native web apps’ that can run on many different devices. Want to know what the future of Joomla looks like? <a href="http://www.joomladagen.nl/2011/programma/presentaties/592-nooku-platform-web-platform-and-application-framework">Don’t miss this presentation</a>.

  <h3>
    Deploying and maintaining a website with GIT
  </h3>
  
  <p>
    You have just developed a great site. Template is ready, extensions are installed, everything neatly tested and ready for the big day! Only deploy the site on the server, upload via FTP &#8230; right?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Well no, that’s so 90’s! How will you handle changes, new extension, bug fix, template improvements &#8230; FTP will quickly become your worst nightmare. Maintaining sites becomes fun in 2011!  <a href="http://www.joomladagen.nl/2011/programma/presentaties/594-workshop-hoe-deploy-en-onderhoud-je-een-website-met-git">This workshop</a> is not to be missed for integrators who want to make life easier for themselves.
