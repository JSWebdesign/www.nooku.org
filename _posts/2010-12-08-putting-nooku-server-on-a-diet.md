Development of [Nooku Server][1] is blazing ahead. Integration of the multi-site features has started. If all goes as planned we should be able to demo a first workable version on our u[pcoming Nooku Jam in Rotterdam][2] this weekend.

At Nooku we pride ourselves by doing more with less. And when we mean less we mean a lot less, as[ Stian nicely demostrated][3] in his latest blog post.   
Joomla 1.5 counts nearly 300k lines of code. That&#8217;s a lot of code ! Before we start improving Nooku Server, we would like to cut away any unused features.

To do that we need your help. We are curious to find out which Joomla core extensions you are using, and more importantly what features you are not using. If you have a moment please fill out our little form below and let us know. Thanks !
