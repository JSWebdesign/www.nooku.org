Last week we were invited by [Eduvision][2] to their [annual Joomla! Conference][3] to talk about setting up a multi-lingual website with Nooku Content and Joomla! 1.5.

During our presentation we touched on the how&#8217;s and why&#8217;s of multi-lingual websites and demo&#8217;ed [Nooku Content 0.5][4].

The overall feedback from the crowd was very positive. People were excited about the many advantages Nooku Content offers over existing multi-lingual solutions in areas like usability, simplicity, performance etc &#8230;

Also, we were pleasantly surprised to hear how much people appreciated our effort to not only create a next generation multi-language solution for Joomla!, but also to demonstrate that a funded business model can be a great way to create GPL&#8217;ed solutions in true spirit of the licence.

Over the next months we will be talking about Nooku Content at different events across Europe :

*   02 Oct : [Joomla! Bootcamp, Netherlands, Zaltbommel][5]
*   09 Oct : [Joomla! Bootcamp, Belgium, Gent][6]
*   10 Oct :Â  [Joomladay Hungary, Budapest][7]
*   15 Nov : [Joomladay Switzerland, Lucern][8]

Events like these are an ideal time to meet up with the team and see Nooku live in action. Finally if you are organizing a Joomla! event and would like us to talk about Nooku Content or any other Joomla! related subject, [please get in touch.][9]
