  <p>
    This is my first blog post of 2011, so first things first: happy N(ew)ooku Year to all of you!  The beginning of a new year is an ideal moment to reflect on the past and also look forward to the future.
  </p>
  
  <h3>
    The year of you
  </h3>
  
  <p>
    2010 was the <a href="http://blog.nooku.org/2010/04/the-state-of-nooku/">year of the Nooku Community</a>, we’ve build some great new resources to help you collaborate, discuss and build Nooku-powered extensions :
  </p>
  
  <p>
    - The <a href="http://code.nooku.org/">Nooku Developer Portal</a>. We launched our new developer portal . The place to go for developers: you can find our code, bug trackers and activity streams.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    - The <a href="http://lists.nooku.org/">Nooku Mailing List</a>. We made the mailing list public, as well the <a href="http://wiki.nooku.org/">community-maintained wiki</a>. The place to go to ask questions or find information on how to get started with Nooku.
  </p>
  
  <h3>
    Growing an open community
  </h3>
  
  <p>
    We <a href="http://blog.nooku.org/2010/10/nooku-is-going-gplv3/">adopted the GPLv3, LGPLv3 and AGPLv3 </a>license and announced our <a href="http://blog.nooku.org/2010/11/nooku-contributor-agreement/">Nooku Contributor Agreement.</a> Both changes are forming the cornerstones on which we are growing Nooku as a truly <a href="http://jukkaz.wordpress.com/2010/11/08/models-of-corporate-open-source/">open community</a> of <a href="http://blogs.computerworlduk.com/simon-says/2010/09/open-source-community-types/index.htm">co-developers</a>.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    They also herald our ongoing commitment to the values of Free & Open Source Software (FOSS) and reflect our beliefs that having diverse copyright ownership leads to a deeper mutual trust and an assurance that the playing-field remains equal for everyone involved.

  <h3>
    A year in numbers
  </h3>
  
  <p>
    Two years ago, we were not much more than a handful of people with a vision. Today, Nooku is:
  </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      an active team of 10 people
    </li>
    <li>
      20<a href="http://nooku.org/partners.html"> partners</a> from enterprises, governmental organisations, and non-profits
    </li>
    <li>
      350 subscribers in the developer’s <a href="http://lists.nooku.org/">discussion group</a>
    </li>
    <li>
      hundreds of websites powered by Nooku Content and Nooku Framework
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>
    We’ve been out there a lot as well:
  </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      We attended/sponsered and presented Nooku on 4 Joomladays in Europe and one in Asia and we <a href="http://blog.nooku.org/2010/07/nooku-extension-showcase-video/">rocked the house</a> at <a href="http://jandbeyond.org/">Jandbeyond</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
      We co-organized 2 Nooku Jams together with our community, one in <a href="http://blog.nooku.org/2011/01/jamming-in-rotterdam-with-nooku/">Rotterdam, NL</a> and one in <a href="http://blog.nooku.org/2010/10/jamming-in-manila-with-nooku/">Manila, PH</a>
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>
    Code metrics are not a good measurement for the size or quality of a project, but they do help to <a href="http://www.ohloh.net/p/nooku-framework">indicate progress</a>. In our official repositories, we have:
  </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      2778 commits for <a href="https://www.assembla.com/spaces/nooku-framework">Nooku Framework</a>
    </li>
    <li>
      679 commits for <a href="https://www.assembla.com/spaces/nooku-components">Nooku Components</a>
    </li>
    <li>
      269 commits for <a href="https://www.assembla.com/spaces/nooku-examples">Nooku Examples</a>
    </li>
    <li>
      214 commits for Nooku Server
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <h3>
    Looking forward to 2011
  </h3>
  
  <p>
    One of the low’s for 2010 has been that we haven’t been able to release the Nooku Framework 0.7 beta. If it is a consolidation, it’s really <a href="http://blog.nooku.org/2010/09/nooku-community-rocking-on/">turning out to be a killer framework</a>. One thing is a given though: 2011 will be the year of Nooku Framework 0.7.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    One of the things I’m looking most forward to is the release of <a href="http://blog.nooku.org/2010/12/nooku-server-joomla-on-steroids/">Nooku Server 0.7,</a> with a <a href="http://blog.nooku.org/2010/12/putting-nooku-server-on-a-diet/">Joomla 1.5 dieted core</a>, Nooku Framework and a bunch of great features we are really putting Joomla on steroids.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    It&#8217;s clear that the mobile web will become mainstream in a big way in 2011. On top of that, the iPad and tablets and other mobile devices are changing our world and the way we build web applications. Nooku is equipped for this challenge. Our <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer">REST</a>ful framework architecture makes it very easy to build tablet and mobile phone optimized applications, and in 2011 we are going to show you how !
  </p>
  
  <p>
    2010 has been a great year and I’m sure 2011 will be no different ! A big thanks to all our contributors, partners and community members. You are all Nooku Rock Stars !
  </p>
