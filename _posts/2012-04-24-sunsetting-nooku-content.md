The Nooku team is officially announcing the sunset of Nooku Content.</span>

With the end of life of Joomla 1.5 coming up at the end of the month and the integrated [multilingual capabilities that are now available in Joomla 2.5][2], we feel there is no longer a need for a separate multilingual solution for Joomla.

With the sunset of Nooku Content, we are putting all our focus on growing Nooku as [a free and open source web application platform][3].

As [Nooku starts its 5th year,][4] we will slowly leave our Joomla roots behind and wander off into the wider PHP galaxy. Exciting times!

But first, the tool that speaks your language is bidding adieu and we thank all our partners who helped us build Nooku Content.
