Last week, the Nooku Team was at the [Dutch Joomladays][1], as both sponsors and speakers. There was a great turnout, the positive vibe and everybody was genuinely excited about the amazing innovations the Joomlasphere has come up with in the past year.

We have a tradition of showing something new each year at the Dutch Joomladays, so Johan and myself were very proud to officially announce our [Developer Portal][2] and present our very first State of Nooku.

2010 is the year of you, the community! With the upcoming 0.7 beta releases, we feel Nooku Framework is growing up significantly. It’s not feature-complete &#8212; that’s why it’s not a 1.0 release yet. But the features we do have are getting very stable, making it a perfect choice for your next project.

2010 is the year of the Nooku Community, and we’ve announced new resources to help you build Nooku-powered extensions. The [Nooku Developer Portal][2] is the first place to go: you can find the code, the bug tracker and activity streams. The spaces for Components, Examples and Tools give room to developers to experiment, play and contribute. We’ve made the [mailing list][3] public, as well as the [community-maintained wiki][4].

## Contributions

We’re seeing some very cool contributions from the community: [Christian][5] is building an extended version of the [com_harbour][6] example component, [Torkil][7] is working on [versioning][8], [Stian][9] wrote an amazing [auto-updater][10] for the framework, Steven did a proof of concept for a webhooks component, and the list goes on. And let’s not forget everybody who submitted bug reports and patches, edited the wiki, and helped newcomers on the [mailing list][3].
