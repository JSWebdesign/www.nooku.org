September just got better, we are announcing a Nooku Jam in Hamburg, Germany which will take place on **Sunday, 4th of September 2011** from 10h till 17h.

The Jam is organized together with our friends at [Mambo e.v.][1] & [YOOtheme][2] and will be hosted at the **University of Hamburg** ([Lecture room 006, Faculty for Educational studies, Von-Melle-Park 8][3]).

Nooku Jam Hamburg follows [Joomladay Deutschland][4]. If you are a Joomla or PHP developer looking to learn how to build better Joomla extensions faster you don’t want to miss this and will stay an extra day. Don’t miss the opportunity to get down and dirty with the Nooku Framework. [Don’t wait, register now][5]!

### Revealing secrets

[Nooku Framework][6] is considered by many as one of the most interesting developments in the Joomlasphere of the last year. Not only because of the **spectacular code reduction** (up to 80%), but also for the many features that were previously unavailable to Joomla developers:

*   Near-zero-code HMVC
*   REST support
*   Object Relational Mapping
*   Out of the box security features
*   Extensibility through CoC, DI, Mixins …
*   Extreme re-usability

Not only are we bringing you a powerful new framework. We&#8217;re also working on **Nooku Server**, a multi-site Joomla 1.5 distribution. During the Jam we will reveal some amazing **secrets** of [Nooku Server Alpha3][7], released on the 1st of July.

### What can you expect?

A Nooku Jam is very much a hands-on event. It&#8217;s a “participatory [unconference][8]”, so you, the attendees are going to be making the event as great as it can be. The idea is that everyone who comes takes part in some way: that might be running a session, taking photos, blogging, tweeting etc.

So don’t forget to bring your laptop, camera, your questions, ideas, and if you want you can prepare a small presentation yourself.

### Harbour: Pirates going Nooku

[Christian Hent][9] will be among the Jammers. He’s Captain of [com_harbour][10], Nooku’s example component. If you want to dive into the Harbour code, this is your chance to do it under the guidance of its Captain.

*“The code is more what you&#8217;d call &#8220;guidelines&#8221; than actual rules.”*

### Can’t make it?

Don’t worry, we’re planning more Jams in the near future. In the mean time, check out our public SVN which is available through the [Nooku Developer Portal][11].
