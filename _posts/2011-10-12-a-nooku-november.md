It happened in September, and it is going to happen again next month &#8211; the Nooku flag is up in two continents in November! Nooku finds its way back to Asia and is going back to its roots in Belgium! Presenting the second [Nooku Jam Manila][1] and the first [Nooku Jam Leuven][2].

Following a very successful [Nooku Jam Manila in 2010][3], Johan is back to give developers  another whirlwind experience with the Nooku Framework. Israel and Myra, Timble’s Manila team, will also be around to help facilitate the event.

Nooku Jam Manila will be held on **Friday, November 4, 2011** at the **[Exist][4] TechBar in Ortigas, Metro Manila**. If you are a passionate Joomla/PHP developer, join us for a day of technology, hacking and fun. And the hard work will pay off at the after party at the end of the day to start the celebrations for a great Nooku year.

The techbar can only hosts **20 developers. **We expect to sell out quick so make sure to **[register early][1]**!

With the Nooku headquarters just a few miles away, the Nooku Jam almost comes home on the **26-27th of November in Leuven, Belgium**. Our friends from [**FlandersDC**][5] will host the Jam in their uber awesome [**Creativity Lab**][6] which will be opened for us specially during the weekend.

Except not one day, but a full weekend of intense presentations, discussions, brainstorms, workshops, hackathons, &#8230; around specific areas of the Nooku project. And offcourse in good Nooku tradition there will be a Nooku Party!

This Jam is a great opportunity for Nookuers to meet in person, to put a face on a lot of quirky mailing list and IM nicknames, and to spend some quality time together!

The Nooku Jam is organised together with community partners ([Timble][7], [MoyoWeb][8], [Pincoding][9], [Beyounic][10], [FlandersDC][5]). We are still looking for companies to help sponsor the event. Interested? [Get in touch][11].

If you are a Nooku, Joomla or PHP developer this is a Jam not to miss ! The Creativity Lab of FlandersDC can host a **maximum of 50 people**. [Don&#8217;t wait to][2]**[ register][2]!**
