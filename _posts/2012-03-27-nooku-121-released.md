<span id="internal-source-marker_0.20236015669070184">Busy times in the Nooku Project. Contributions are literally pouring in. Things are moving so fast that I haven’t had the time to write about the 12.1 release that went out last month. Besides this being our first real release, lots of great code also made it in.</span>

Sticking to our new 4 month release cycle we officially tagged Nooku 12.1 (/tags/12.1) in all our repositories on the [Nooku Developer Portal][1]. At the same time, we also moved the 12.2 release in the trunk (/trunk) and started the development of 12.3 (/branches/development).

### A stable first release

This first release is mostly a maintenance release. Lots of bugs and issues discovered after t[he last alpha][2] have been fixed. We also focussed on making sure that Nooku Framework is fully compatible with all Joomla versions up to 2.5.x.

The 1200 commits made by not less than [12 rockstar developers][3] from all over the world show how dedicated our community is to making Nooku solid and useable in a production environment. Thanks everyone!

Divided by 12 weeks, that’s an average of 108 commits/week or 21 commits a day. Not bad for ‘only’ a maintenance release!

Full list of changes:

*   [Nooku Server 12.1 milestone][4]
*   [Nooku Framework 12.1 milestone][5]
*   [Nooku Components 12.1 milestone][6]

<!--more-->

### Backwards compatibility

There is no backwards compatibility between releases. The changes between the 12.1 and alpha versions have been documented on the wiki.

*   [Nooku Framework changelog][7]

If you are using Nooku Framework for public/commercial Joomla components, remember that you MUST update to 12.1! We will find you if you don’t ;)

### What is happening next?

With the 12.1 release out the door, our focus has now shifted to the testing and stabilisation of 12.2 (/trunk) and development of 12.3 (/branches/development). Work in trunk and development is done at the same time. This means the release of 12.2 is planned for May/June, while 12.3 will be released in Sep/Oct.

If you are using Nooku for your project, you can either contribute features to 12.3 or you can help with the testing and stabilizing of the 12.2 release.
