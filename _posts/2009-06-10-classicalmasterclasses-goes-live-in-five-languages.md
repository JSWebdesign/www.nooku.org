[Classicalmasterclasses.com][1], the new search portal for music masterclasses has gone online. Professors and institutions can register their courses and students can easily search them with different filters. The site has been built with Joomla and is powered by Nooku Content. To capture an international audience classes are offered in five languages: German, English, Italian, French and Spanish.
