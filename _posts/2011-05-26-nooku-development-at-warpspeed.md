    Not even 6 months ago we <a href="http://blog.nooku.org/2010/12/nooku-server-joomla-on-steroids/">announced our plans for Nooku Server</a>, a multi-site distribution of Joomla 1.5. We created a <a href="http://blog.nooku.org/2011/01/creating-a-diet-for-nooku-server/">diet for Nooku Server</a> and <a href="http://blog.nooku.org/2011/01/a-roadmap-for-nooku-server/">defined a roadmap</a>. We initially planned to add multi-site support, caching improvements and a new administrator template which we did in <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/nooku-framework/browse_thread/thread/bc8c88a8e81a75c9/3169bfda8bcad2cc?lnk=gst&q=alpha+1#3169bfda8bcad2cc">alpha 1</a> and <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/nooku-framework/browse_thread/thread/3dba8a70956726ff/ce7ab509bc774ecf?lnk=gst&q=alpha+2#ce7ab509bc774ecf">alpha 2</a>, and then … community happened!
  </p>
  
  <p>
    We couldn’t have expected so much enthusiasm from developers from all over the world who wanted to help out and contribute. Simply amazing!

    We <a href="http://blog.nooku.org/2010/11/nooku-contributor-agreement/">announced our contributor agreement</a> in November last year. In the past 6 months our contributor base has grown, from a handful to a total of 35. That’s a lot of developer power!

    Not less then 21 developers contributed to Nooku in the past year working on various projects. As you can see from <a href="http://www.ohloh.net/p/compare?project_0=Joomla%21&project_1=Nooku&project_2=Drupal+%28core%29">this link</a> and the graph above (taken from <a href="http://www.ohloh.net/p/compare?project_0=Joomla%21&project_1=Nooku&project_2=Drupal+%28core%29">Ohloh</a>) that’s more than double the amount of people who contributed to Joomla in the same period. Not bad huh!

    Nooku development is literally moving ahead at warp-speed. Last September, we reported that we were slowly <a href="http://blog.nooku.org/2010/09/nooku-community-rocking-on/#more-457">earning our spot with the big boys</a>. Today, we are in the lead. Pure innovation!

Today Nooku Server SVN is counting 1500 commits. With all the <a href="http://nooku.assembla.com/">spaces</a> combined, we have more then 6000 commits, that’s nearly 3000 commits in 8 months! As you can see from the graph above (taken from Ohloh) our development activity is more then three times higher then Joomla. Yes we can!
