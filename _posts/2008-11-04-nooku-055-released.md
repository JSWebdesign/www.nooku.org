What&#8217;s going on for Nooku Content ? We released v0.5.5 last week to our partners, and things are looking good. This is just a small maintenance release, which fixes some leftover bugs. In the meantime, an incredible amount of work has gone into v0.6.0.

Doing 0.5.x releases while taking our time to work on 0.6, is a great way to offer stability to our users. By being very conservative about making changes in 0.5.x releases, they can be sure that their current Nooku sites stay stable and secure. And at the same time it gives the Nooku development team the freedom to make any crazy new change we want, without having to worry about breaking existing Nooku sites.

Stick around, we&#8217;ll be announcing some exciting new features in Nooku Content 0.6, that will make setting up multilingual, search engine optimised Joomla sites easier than ever before!
