Nooku is going Asia and will be setting up camp in **Manila** on the **20th of September**.  Together with our friends from the Joomla and PHP communities in the Philippines, we are organizing our first Asian Nooku Code Jam.

If you are a PHP developer looking to learn how to build better Joomla extensions faster you don’t want to miss this.[ Nooku Framework][1] is one of the most interesting developments in the Joomlasphere of the last year. 

Not only because of the **spectacular code reduction** (up to 80% in some cases), but also for the many features that were previously unavailable to Joomla developers:

*   Near-zero-code MVC
*   Domain Driven Design
*   Object Relational Mapping
*   Out of the box security features
*   Extensibility through CoC, DI, &#8230;

And not to forget **extreme re-usability**: already a number of extensions are being built that can be plugged right into your own, such as user, trash and taxonomy (tagging and categories) management.

The Code Jam will take place on the **20th of September **at the** University of the Philippines** from **8:****30 until 17:00.** To help us cover our cost we ask a small registration fee : ** 500 PHP for professionals **and** 250 PHP for students**. We have only **45 seats** available, so <a title="registration form" href="http://nooku-code-jam-manila-2010.eventbrite.com/" target="_blank"><strong>register fast!</strong></a>

### What can you expect?

[Nooku][2] Code Jams are fun and informal events that focus on developing with the [Nooku Framework][1]. The day starts with the grand tour of the framework. What does it do, what are the concepts and philosophies behind it, etc. 

Next we will play a little game called the &#8216;MVC roulette&#8217; and move on to show you how to build a small but fully functional MVC component using only a ridiculously small amount of lines of code.

After lunch, it’s Nooku Workshop time. You get to make your hands dirty ! Depending on your experience with PHP and Joomla, you get to build your own component using what you’ve learned. Or if you’re more experienced you can join the advanced workshop where we dive deep into the Nooku Framework API to learn how to build ultra powerful and extendible extensions.

### Can’t make it ?

Don’t worry, we’re planning more Code Jams in the near future. In the mean time, if you want to get your hands dirty you check out our public SVN which is available through the Nooku Developer Portal at <http://code.nooku.org> For more info on getting started make sure to check out the getting Started information on our [wiki][3].

### Organizing your own code jam ?

Organize a Nooku Code Jam yourself? All you need is a venue that can hold about 15 – 25 people (and if possible an extra room for breakout sessions), wifi and a projector.  [Get in touch][4] for more information.
