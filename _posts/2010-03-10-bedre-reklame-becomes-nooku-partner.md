BEDRE  reklame have been at the forefront of Joomla development in Norway since Joomla was born, so we are very excited when they chose to Partner with us.

Although the Partnership originally focused on Nooku Content, it was the underlying [ Nooku Framework][2] that really opened BEDRE reklame&#8217;s eyes.

According to Torkil Johnsen, &#8220;The Nooku Framework has so far proven to be both a time and lifesaver. Thanks to this technology, we are able to produce more secure and robust code in a shorter amount of time, when creating Joomla extensions&#8221;.

As our first Norwegian partner, BEDRE reklame is now enjoying the benefits of Joomla&#8217;s only  enterprise grade translation system as well as the RAD framework that made it possible. Definitely a win win for [BEDRE reklame][1].

We would like to thank BEDRE reklame for their support, and look forward to many years of mutually beneficial development on Nooku Content and Nooku Framework.
