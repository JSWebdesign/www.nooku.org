title: Jack Bremer interviews Mathias Verraes

    During our three days at J! And Beyond, the International Joomla Conference, I was interviewed about Nooku Framework.
    We talked about the growing Nooku Community and the origins of the Nooku Content and Nooku Framework. In the middle it gets a bit technical, but hold on, after that there’s some fun stuff about the Joomlasphere’s obsession with Swahili names.

During our three days at [J! And Beyond][1], the International Joomla Conference, I was interviewed about Nooku Framework. Jack Bremer did an excellent job (it’s hard to believe he’s not a professional interviewer!)

We talked about the growing Nooku Community and the origins of [Nooku Content][2] and [Nooku Framework][3]. In the middle it gets a bit technical, but hold on, after that there’s some fun stuff about the Joomlasphere’s obsession with Swahili names.



The interview was taped by Zohar Babin. He was at J! And Beyond in his role as Director of Developer Relations and Community for [Kaltura][4], the open source video platform, as they were sponsoring the event. Zohar decided to take the opportunity to learn more about Joomla, by interviewing a number of people in the community. I’m proud to have been one of them. Check out his technology blog for more interviews [here][5] and [here][6].

Jack Bremer, the interviewer, runs [3B Digital][7] in London, a full-service digital marketing agency who specialise in Joomla projects, SEO and social media.
