Nooku Content was &#8216;soft&#8217; launched at the Dutch Joomla!Day.  The interest in this Joomlatools multi-lingual solution has been incredible and, as a result, we&#8217;re confident it will soon establish itself as the preferred content translation solution for Joomla!

Marc Alen, of Belgium Local Police, presented a case study of his implementation of Nooku Content and Joomla! 1.5.  While Marc says he&#8217;s working on a &#8216;small project&#8217; we beg to differ.  Hundreds of installations, servicing the entire Belgium local police service ain&#8217;t small!

As one of Nooku&#8217;s partners, the police service has assisted by providing specification requirements which fit with its culture.  The result has been an extremely flexible, powerful piece of architecture which allows for future scalability.

Nooku Content delivers with workflow systems, tier managability and low performance overhead.  It has been designed to be as resource neutral as possible.  The user experience is a seamless fit into the Joomla! 1.5 administration.
