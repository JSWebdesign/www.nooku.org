Just over three years ago, on 12 February 2008, we made the [first commit][1] to our beloved Nooku Framework. Today, [Nooku Framework][2] drastically speeds up the creation and maintenance of Joomla extensions while eliminating repetitive coding and adding power, flexibility and fun. Finally, you can focus on what matters most: your extension’s business logic and user experience.

> Definition: &#8220;to nookify&#8221; (verb) : Collaborating to make code reusable, flexible and magical. Often leads to reduction of 60-80% in code.

### Introducing Nooku Platform



On the 4th of February 2011, we attended the first ever [Joomlanight][3] in Stockholm, Sweden. The topic of this event was “Joomla: At The Edge Of Innovation” and hosted three talks:

*   “The Road Ahead for Joomla!” by Ryan Ozimek
*   “Molajo Joomla! 1.6 Distribution” by Marco Barbosa
*   “Nooku &#8211; Evolving and Innovating Joomla!” by our own Johan Janssens

Johan introduced the Nooku Platform, vision, strategy and roadmap:

*   Nooku Framework, rapid extension development framework
*   Nooku Server, multi-site and multi-lingual distribution of Joomla
*   Nooku Community, innovative and open source community

The event was broadcasted live on the inter-tubes, thanks to Martin Blodau. If you missed it, sit back and enjoy Johan’s talk. We also made the presentation available [here][4].

### Nooku train is setting course to Alpha1

<img class="alignleft" title="The Nooku Train" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4031/4536195092_9407942e60_m.jpg" alt="" width="200" /> Earlier this year, we announced a [roadmap for Nooku Server][5]. First stop of the Nooku train is [Alpha1 on the 20th of this month][6]. This means that all our public spaces following the 0.7 development cycle: Framework, Server, Components and Examples will be tagged as Alpha1.

But you don’t have to wait! Our [Nooku Developer Portal][7] gives you easy access to all our public spaces including the latest and hottest Nooku Server space.

### Community at work

Three years ago, we were not much more than a handful of people with a vision. Today, Nooku is:

*   an active team of 10 people
*   20 contributors who signed the [Contributor Agreement][8]
*   360 subscribers in the [developer’s discussion group][9]
*   hundreds of websites powered by Nooku Framework

Code metrics are not a good measurement for the size or quality of a project, but they do help to indicate progress. In our official [repositories][7], we have almost:

*   3000 commits for Nooku Framework
*   700 commits for Nooku Components
*   300 commits for Nooku Examples
*   400 commits for Nooku Server

Happy 3rd birthday to the Nooku Framework and kudos to our community for driving Nooku towards the edge of innovation!
