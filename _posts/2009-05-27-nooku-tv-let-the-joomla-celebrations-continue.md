In keeping with our love of [Joomla][1], the world&#8217;s best award winning CMS, [Nooku TV][2] launched today to herald some exciting news.

We are creating some of the most exciting software technologies possible for Joomla. If you want to learn more about what we are doing, see our work in action and learn about how other people use it be sure to tune in. We hope to have regular videocasts with developers, community members and experts such as our own Johan (Doctor Nooku) Janssens and Mathias Verraes.

In this premiere episode we interview Dutch Joomladay organiser [Sander Potjer ][3]who provides an insight into the fortcoming Joomladays to be held in the Netherlands. Sander, also is an early adopter of the Nooku multi-lingual solution, which is used on the[ http://www.joomladays.nl/][4] site.

We will be presenting at [three sessions][5] at the Joomladays. We&#8217;re lucky enough to be presenting along side some [other great speakers.][6]&nbsp; You probably think that given the amount of activity we&#8217;ve been having in our labs that we&#8217;ve run out of fresh things to show you. Think again! But to find out you&#8217;re going to need to attend the show.

Without any further delay, let&#8217;s get on with the show!
