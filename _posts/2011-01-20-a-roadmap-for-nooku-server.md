  <p>
    With Nooku Server’s <a href="http://blog.nooku.org/2011/01/creating-a-diet-for-nooku-server">diet established</a>, we now have a good idea of the work that needs to be done. A next step in the process is to define a little roadmap.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Over the next 4 months, we are going to be rolling out alpha releases implementing the key ingredients as defined in our little diet and at the same time adding key features.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    We will be working towards releasing an alpha about once every four weeks. This gives the following roadmap :
  </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      Alpha 1 : February
    </li>
    <li>
      Alpha 2 : March
    </li>
    <li>
      Alpha 3 : April
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>
    Under ideal conditions Nooku Server would go beta in May 2011, right in time for <a href="http://www.jandbeyond.org">JAB11</a>.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Our development flow will be focused on maintaining the stability of the Joomla 1.5 core. Scope for the alpha releases will be kept very limited in order to avoid <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scope_creep">scope creep</a>. For each alpha we will focus on one major feature or task.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Alpha 1</strong> will be focused on the implementing the <strong>key ingredients of our diet</strong>, in <strong>alpha 2</strong> we are going to add the <strong>multi-site</strong> features and for <strong>alpha 3</strong> we plan to move Nooku Content, our <strong>multi-lingual</strong> solution into Nooku Server. Yes, you read that right ! Nooku Server will not only be multi-site but also multi-lingual. You will truly get Joomla on steroids!
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The release schedule allows for additional features to be added, however to avoid the stress that comes from arguing about scope &#8230; and whether a feature needs to be in the release, and how we will stretch to squeeze it in, … features can be developed by a contributor in a branch and when ready merged with the trunk.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The release schedule of Nooku Framework will also be synced with that of Nooku Server. More info about the exact tasks/tickets for each alpha can be found on the <a href="https://nooku.assembla.com/spaces/nooku-framework/tickets">Nooku Framework ticket tracker</a>.
