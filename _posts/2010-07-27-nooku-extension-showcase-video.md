More and more Joomla developers are starting to use Nooku Framework for building powerful, extendible and secure Joomla extensions. The [first][1] [generation][2] of [extensions][3] is in beta and more extensions are being worked.

Just like the Joomla 1.5 framework caused a wave of innovative extensions, we believe Nooku Framework is going to cause a shift: It changes how you **create and use extension**s, how extensions work **with each other or with external data**, and how you **customize extensions**.

At [J! and Beyond 2010][4] we, together with some of our Nooku Community Contributors and Partners showed some of the promising Nooku-powered extensions that are being built right now. Check out the video and take a sneak peek into Joomla&#8217;s future !
