With the upcoming release of Nooku Server Alpha 4 we have almost completely refactored all components to Nooku Framework. Some very exciting innovations have been introdcued : multi-site support, content versioning, [file management][1], [lightened Joomla core][2], [overhauled administrator interface][3], [mobile and dekstop support][4] &#8230;

In the coming weeks we are taking Nooku Server on tour to show you what we have been working on. This is your chance to meet our contributors and get to see the magic in action !

### Joomladay Thailand

October is ending with Nooku magic in the land of smiles. Our own Johan Janssens will be at this yearâ€™s <a href="http://www.joomladay.in.th/en.html" target="_blank">Joomladay Bangkok</a> joining other international speakers on the 29th of October. [Nooku][5] is also proud to be a sponsor of this event.



Last year, Johan <a href="http://vimeo.com/channels/nooku#23581843 " target="_blank">announced Nooku Server at the Joomladay in Bangkok</a>. A year later Johan is going back to Bangkok to show Nooku Server in action. He will be talking about the multi-site capabilities of Nooku Server and dive into the new file management features that have been introduced in Alpha 4.

### Joomladay Sydney

We are starting November by bringing you Nooku down under. [Shayne Bartlett][6], Nooku Contributor and [Timble][7] Project Manager will be traveling to the [Joomladay Sydney][8] on the 5th of November to give you a [sneak peak into Nooku Server and Framework][9]. 

See you there!
