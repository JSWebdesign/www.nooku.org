On Wednesday, 19 January 2011,  Joomla integrators and PHP developers gathered at the [University of Lugano][1], CH for the first Swiss Nooku Jam. The Jam took place during the annual Beyounic Camp, a strategic workshop hosted by our friends from Beyounic.

[Beyounic][3] is the team behind [Ohanah][4], a social event management platform built on [Nooku Framework][5]. They have become great friends in the past year and we (Tom and myself) were very excited to travel to Lugano to see their new office and organize a Nooku Jam together.

### Geeks, students and teachers

Despite the exam period, we got a room full of interested informatics students, teachers and many other great people coming also from abroad. ([@andreatorre][6] came over all the way from Rome, Italy [@luscarpa][7] joined us from Venice, Italy)



With so many really talented people in the room, we were able to touch some very technical topics. Design patterns, use of web 3.0/semantic technologies, security, etc. Feedback during and after the event was great.  The Jam was well appreciated by the faculty program manager and the participants.

### First Nooku Developer Group

The afternoon after the event, a group of students got really interested in learning more about the Nooku Framework. For us this means the first seed for a swiss Nooku developer group has been successfully planted!

### Workshopping and brainstorming

The rest of the week flew by quickly being fully immersed on a really productive workshop with the Beyounic Team. We spent time working on Nooku Framework Incubator ideas and on the Ohanah business model. The Ohanah roadmap is now in place and there will soon be some good news for the Joomla world, stay tuned. Keep a close watch on [Ohanah.com][8].

### Inspiring week

It was an amazing, inspiring and collaborative week. Excellent weather, lots of fun, Italian coffee and good food. It is always a great and inspiring experience to be working together, with good friends from Beyounic, on what we mostly love, and at the same time to see project cooperation from two companies walking on the same path. Thanks again guys!
