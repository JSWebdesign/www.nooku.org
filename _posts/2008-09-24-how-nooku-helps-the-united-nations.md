The United Nations has gone live with its [first Nooku Content powered site][1]. They first got in touch with us in January 2008 when they were looking for a professional multi-lingual solution to migrate their [European portal][2] to Joomla 1.5.

&#8220;We evaluated many open source software solutions and found Joomla to be the best for us,&#8221; says Philippe Chabot, ICT coordinator at the United Nations. &#8220;When we looked at our two options, Drupal did not perform as well as Joomla. Now that we have a lot of experience with Joomla we are no longer looking at other applications. Of course, from time to time, for risk management best practices we will evaluate all available options.&#8221;

### Making a multi-lingual Joomla website

&#8220;In the previous version of our [European portal][2], we used a free extension called Joomfish,&#8221; says Chabot, &#8220;but with our new Joomla 1.5 website we needed something that could handle our requirements in terms of performance and usability.&#8221;

And a big organization has big requirements: the UN is running an [information portal in 13 languages][3], with a European audience that averages 50,000 monthly visitors and delivers over 5 million page views a month.

&#8220;Before migrating more than 30.000 articles and translations into a new version of the entire site using Nooku, we decided to run a test case. We used Nooku Content for a campaign we have developed called &#8216;Know Your Rights&#8217;, for the 60th anniversary of the Human Rights Declaration.&#8221; The site can be found at <http://html.knowyourrights2008.org/> .

The site was built internally, but with some help from an external designer with experience working with Joomla. There are three staff members running & maintaining the site, but none of them are developers!

### Straightforward translations

&#8220;We found working with Nooku Content extremely easy and straightforward. Nooku Content also offers a lot of reporting and graphs, that we haven&#8217;t even fully explored yet!&#8221; When asked what he likes best about Nooku Content , Philippe Chabot replied: &#8220;Its seamless integration into Joomla and the outstanding performance make it a great solution for high performing multilingual websites.&#8221;
