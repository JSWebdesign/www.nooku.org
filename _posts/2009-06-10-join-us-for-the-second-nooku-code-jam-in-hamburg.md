Last month, the team at [Delius][1], one of our Nooku partners, organised the first Nooku Code Jam in Ghent, Belgium. Among the visitors where Sascha and Steffan from [YOOTheme][2], creators of the [Zoo][3] extension. The [Nooku Framework][4] must have made quite an impression. Not only are they looking into using it for their new extensions, they also agreed to organize a second **Nooku Code Jam in Hamburg, Germany on June 27th.**

If you are a developer, and just like us want to bring future-proof Web 2.0 development to Joomla, come and join us in Hamburg. Just [contact us here][5] with some information about yourself. The event takes place from **9:00 until 17:00** and the **registration fee is 25 euro** to cover our costs.

### What can you expect?

Nooku Code Jams are fun and informal events. The day starts with the grand tour of the framework. What does it do, what are the concepts and philosophies behind it, etc. Next we show you how to build a small but fully functional MVC component, using only a ridiculously small amount of lines of code.

After lunch, it&#8217;s Nooku Workshop time. You get to make your hands dirty ! Depending on your experience with PHP and Joomla, you get to build your own component using what you&#8217;ve learned. Or if you&#8217;re more experienced you can join the advanced workshop where we dive deep into the Nooku Framework API to learn how to build ultra powerful and extendible extensions.
