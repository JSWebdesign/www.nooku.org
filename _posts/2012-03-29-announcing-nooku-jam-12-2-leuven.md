Check out the some of the [photo highlights][4] and insights from last year’s Jam.

> This jam (was) followed the more informal [barcamp][5] format, which relies on spontaneous input by all the attendants. The attendants were to come up with their own ideas for talks, along with things they would like to hear about. These poles of ideas were quickly refactored into walls of ideas. &#8211; Moyoweb

> While the other events that I have been to always left me a little exhausted, I left this one feeling inspired and motivated. I’m looking forward to work with all the great guys around Nooku in the future and am excited about all the stuff that is coming up. &#8211; David Deutsch

### What is a Nooku Jam?

A Nooku Jam is an open, participatory workshop-event, whose content is provided by participants. The concept is very similar to a [barcamp][6]. It is an intense event with discussions, demos and interaction from the attendees.

Nooku Jams are never your traditional conferences &#8211; they are more of an ad-hoc unconference born from the desire for people to share and learn in an open environment.  Anybody can speak on any topic that they are passionate about. For Nooku developers, this means their latest code, component, or mini project.

### There are no spectators, only participants.

Attendees must give a demo, a session, or help with one, or otherwise volunteer / contribute in some way to support the event. Participants won&#8217;t need to decide what to talk about until they get there. All presentations are scheduled the day they happen.

The day starts with the session suggestions. Everybody describes the kind of session they can do. Then the session gets pinned on the board for a certain time slot. After the planning – voila – there is a schedule and the sessions start.

### It’s always about community

Anyone with something to contribute or with the desire to learn is welcome and invited to join a Nooku Jam. When you come, be prepared to share with other attendees. When you leave, be prepared to share it with the world.

The jam is the perfect event for Nooku magic offline! [Register][1] today, we only have 30 seats available.
