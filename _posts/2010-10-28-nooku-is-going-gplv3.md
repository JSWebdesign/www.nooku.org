[<img class="alignright" title="GPLv3 - Free as in Freedom" src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1073/5122830971_04bdd362c4_m.jpg" alt="GPLv3 Logo" width="240" height="126" />][1] After careful consideration, we decided to adopt the [GPLv3][2], [LGPLv3][3] and [AGPLv3][4] licences for all future releases of Nooku. All versions of Nooku numbered 0.7 and later will be under the GPLv3, all versions of Nooku numbered 0.6 and before remain under the GPLv2.

The GPLv3 is the updated version of the GPLv2 license under which Nooku is currently distributed and improves Nookuâ€™s compatibility with other licenses whilst making it easier to adopt internationally.

The latest incarnation of the GPL license, GPLv3 is designed to better suit the needs of Free Software in the 21st Century. We recommend you take the time to read [this guide][5] on the GPLv3 so as to gain a clearer understanding of both your rights and your obligations under this license.

This change heralds our ongoing commitment to the values of Free & Open Source Software (FOSS). It will allow developers and end users alike to be confident in their choice to use Nooku and applications derived from it.
