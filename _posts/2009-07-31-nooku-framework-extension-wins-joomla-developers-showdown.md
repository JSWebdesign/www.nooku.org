The premise was to create a fully functional and documented extension in four days. The extension had to meet some basic requirements based around a concept of a company directory.

### Beer without the headaches

Being a competitive bunch we couldn&#8217;t resist and so Team Nooku was formed to complete the challenge and the humourosly named B.E.E.R was born &#8212; short for Business Enterprise Employee Repository. The task was to develop a component to satisfy the needs of &#8220;***Impossible Missions Force***&#8220;:

> IMF employ 200 people in five departments spread across 10 offices around the world. They require a directory of all employees for their new corporate web site. At a minimum each employee record should include a photograph, contact details, job title and a contact form. IMF hope that you will be able to provide multiple methods to navigate the directory including by name, location, department.

Have a look at the <a title="resulting alpha version" href="http://showdown.nooku.org/beer.html" target="_blank">resulting alpha version</a>, powered by BEER and the underlying Nooku Framework.

Current features include:

*   People, Departments, Offices
*   Template Overrides support
*   Gravatar support
*   VCard support
*   Plugin support
*   Search engine friendly URL&#8217;s
*   Single installer
*   Search plugin

### Rapid Application Development

By creating a winning alpha version of B.E.E.R., team Nooku has been able to demonstrate Nooku Framework&#8217;s rapid development capability. &#8220;Someone in the Nooku community saidÂ  the framework was &#8216;An alien life form that makes Joomla smarter&#8217;. It certainly is setting new benchmarks with every iteration we release,&#8221; Mathias Verraes said.

&#8220;Over the past few months we have been holding [Nooku Code Jams][1] where Joomla developers can learn how to leverage the Nooku Framework. We also started doing in-house training sessions for companies looking to build more flexible Joomla extensions.&#8221;

&#8220;We think the groundswell of developer interest will eventually manifest into a very powerful movement that is nothing but positive for the Joomla community overall. More power, more flexibility, more reusability. It&#8217;s the next generation MVC that Joomla was craving for,&#8221; Mathias said.

&#8220;If you&#8217;re a developer and you want a competitive edge with your component development, Nooku Framework is a must.&#8221;
