We are pleased to announce the release of [Nooku Content][1] version 0.6.6. This version is a bug fix release that addresses a number of issues that where reported by our partners. A few smaller features where also added :

*   **Better language syncing**. We have made a number of changes to the way Nooku Content handles it&#8217;s language syncing especially during installation of extensions. Nooku Content is now smart enough to sync modules that are installed as part of the installation of a packaged extension. For example, DOCman, or K2, etc ..
*   **Better error handling**. We re-worked our error handling to throw nice and meaning-full error messages when something goes wrong, for example when a language cannot be found.

If you want to see Nooku Content in action, you can find our team this weekend at the[ J and Beyond conference][2] We are sponsoring the event and are also doing a Nooku Framework workshop on Tuesday.

Nooku Content is only available to our partners. By supporting us, you helps us to build quality open source software. In return you get a great extension, personalized support, and a voice in the development. If you want to learn more, discover our [Partnership Program][3].
