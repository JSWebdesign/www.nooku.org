The first <a title="Nooku Demo Day last March" target="_blank" href="en/buzz/86-nooku-demo-day-report.html">Nooku Demo Day last March</a> was a fun gettogether. We got one complaint however: apparently all Joomla events in The Netherlands are in the South of the country. [Jamii][1], one of our Nooku Partners, decided it was time for a change. They&#8217;re inviting colleagues, customers, and friends (and anybody who&#8217;s interested) for a second **Dutch Nooku Demo Day on the 16th of October**, all the way up north in [Slagharen][2].

We love it when our partners organize events, so of course we happily accepted the invitation to come and show the latest and greatest developments in [Nooku Content][3] (the multilingual extension for Joomla), and [Nooku Framework][4] (the rapid application development platform for Joomla).

Get to know Nooku, the team behind it, and your fellow website developers, all of this in a relaxing atmosphere. We will demonstrate how easy it is to setup multi-lingual websites with Nooku, answers questions, discuss the challenges professionals face and learn from each other.
