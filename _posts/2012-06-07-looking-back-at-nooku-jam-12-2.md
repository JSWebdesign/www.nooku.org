<span id="internal-source-marker_0.9827679025474936">The Nooku Jam 12.2 is over and like all Nooku events, we had a blast! Twenty four <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/nooku/nj12leuven">attendees</a> flocked to the green grass of the <a href="http://www.flandersdc.be/en">FlandersDC Creativity Lab</a> on the 16th and 17th of May for two days of talks, coding, hacking, sharing and fun around the Nooku project.</span>

The [Jam][1], sponsored by [Mindk][2], [Beyounic][3] and [Timble][4], was an inspiring weekend for the Nooku community.

  The recipe: great ideas, creative people, lots of food and Belgian beer and an inspiring venue! Check our <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/nooku/sets/72157630033392080/">photostream</a> or read Tom’s story on <a href="http://sfy.co/12pR">storify</a> for evidence of the inspiring weekend.

  The Talks
</h3>

The jam was full to the brim with presentations about Nooku, PHP and web technologies around it. For this Jam we invited Nils Adermann, from [ComposorPHP][5] fame, to indulge us in all the great new stuff he is working on. We were impressed and you can bet that very soon Nooku will be composoretized!

Lot’s of other great sessions too. A handful to mention:

*   Tom’s talk about how we are bringing  [bootstrap and LESS][6] to 12.3
*   Oli demonstrated his [com_tokens component][7] for RESTful tokenized authentication
*   Oleg and Nils shared their experiences with [CouchDb][8]
*   Gergo did a demo on the new [database query builder][9] coming in 12.3
*   Nick, Ercan and Stian discussed javascript MVC with [EmberJS][10] and [AngularJS][11]
*   We talked about how to do agile development using [Kanban][12]
*   and many more&#8230;

Of course in true Nooku tradition there was [cake][13] to celebrate [Nooku’s 4th birthday][14]. Hip hip hooray!
