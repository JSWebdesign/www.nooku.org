The Nooku team is delighted to announce that the Nooku Framework has been publicly released — made available at [Sourceforge.net ][1]

The framework &#8211; which was[ announced last May][2] -  empowers Joomla! 1.5 to new levels and is designed to provide third-party developers with [Joomla&#8217;s missing MVC][3].

Lead architect, Johan Janssens, said the framework will provide developers with &#8220;future-proof&#8221; tools to &#8220;enable exciting and efficient ways to make Joomla better through extendable developement.&#8221;

For the time being access is only available using <a title="nooku framework subversion code repository" href="https://nooku-framework.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/nooku-framework/" target="_blank">Subversion</a> (SVN). Installable packages will be made available once we hit our 0.7 milestone. There&#8217;s a good reason for that: there&#8217;s little documentation at the moment, and we don&#8217;t want to get flooded by emails from people with support questions. The SVN serves as a simple filter.

So where do you go if you have questions ? Simply fill out the form to <a title="get code access and support for nooku framework" href="en/framework/request.html" target="_blank">request access</a>. It only takes two minutes of your time. It&#8217;s a win-win: We get to know a little about you, and you get access to our discussion mailing list, where all the good stuff happens.

&#8230; oh, and you get to use the most advanced framework ever built for Joomla.

Nooku Framework is created by award-winning developers and founding members of Joomla who have been responsible for creative innovation in code for many years.
