After a longer break, I re-joined the Joomla community about a year ago and was first shocked, then a bit confused. [Johan][1], lead developer of Joomla 1.5, had left Joomla and was now working on a new project called Nooku. After the initial shock and confusion, curiosity followed. I signed-up for the [mailing list][2] and before I knew it found myself inside of a community, full with friendly and helpful developers.

<div>
  <p>
    Eagerly I began to explore the possibilities of <a href="http://www.nooku.org/framework">Nooku Framework</a> and played with <a href="http://www.assembla.com/wiki/show/nooku-examples/com_harbour_overview">com_harbour</a>, Nooku’s sample component. I love demos that just work and help me to understand how a framework is intended to be used and com_harbour is just that. It works.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Harbour is a simple component build on Nooku Framework which manages something like a harbour dictionary. It supports BREAD, searching, letter indexes, pagination, ordering, SEF, various possibilities to limit the displayed data by relations, a nice dashboard plus a lot of trifles. The whole component is deliberately kept simple.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    After three months of learning and playing I had some ideas on how to improve it. So I took the bold leap and asked if I could help maintain it and add new features to it. To my surprise I got the job as lead maintainer and have been working on it since.
  </p>

<div>
  <!--more--> Maintaining com_harbour is all about learning, giving back, collaborating and having lot’s of fun doing so. It’s not really hard to develop an example build on top of a PHP framework but to take the responsibility to maintain that example for an uprising framework is a quite an honour and a challenge. At least for me.</p> 
  
  <p>
    In the past my daily morning  routine consisted of reading the latest J! news and tweets, now I first read <a href="https://nooku.assembla.com/spaces/nooku-framework/stream">Nooku’s SVN logs</a>, <a href="http://lists.nooku.org">mailing list</a> and chats to get up to speed on the latest changes in the framework.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    I pride myself in trying to keep the basic functionality of com_harbour is synced with latest revisions of Nooku Framework. Working with the latest bleeding edge code is challenging but also alot of fun.  Sometimes I make mistakes or introduce bugs. In such cases, I can rely on our awesome Nooku community. They are always around to help me fix bugs or answer questions.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Collaboration is one of the biggest advantages of Nooku community. And yes, Nooku developers have an additional personality threat which is worth to be mentioned: They are not only full of respect for each other, they are also great humorous entertainers. Really! I’m sure that this is one cause of the very fertile and productive climate in the Nooku sphere.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If you are new to Nooku development I want to encourage you to <a href="http://www.assembla.com/code/nooku-examples/subversion/nodes/trunk/harbour">try out com_harbour</a>, play with it, try to understand how it works and if you have questions feel free to put those on the mailing list. I’m always happy to help.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Oh and one final personal tip :
  </p>
  
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      Forget most what you learned from other frameworks, especially from the Joomla. Stop thinking inside a box, open up your mind to the great new things that Nooku brings.
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  
  <p>
    And who knows one day you might become lead maintainer of your own Nooku component.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    See you on the mailing list !
