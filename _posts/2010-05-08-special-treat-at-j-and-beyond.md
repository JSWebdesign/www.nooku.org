[<img class="alignright" title="Nooku Sponsors J! And Beyond" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4033/4647741558_e34b148859_o.png" alt="" width="200" />][1]There’s no way you can have missed all the excitement that is building for J! And Beyond, the international Joomla conference in Germany later this month. This is a true **community-organized** event, and we feel that as a company, it is **our duty to give back**. That is why we are very proud to announce that [Nooku is an official sponsor of J! And Beyond][1]!

### Presentations

We’ll be giving two presentations: In his fun warm-up talk “[Joomla to Infinity and Beyond][2]”, Johan will be shedding new light on the amazing journey that is Joomla.

The next talk is for everybody who ever built a website using Joomla (yes, I know, that’s all of you!). We’ll explain [why Nooku Framework matters to you,][3] even if you’re not a developer. Just like the Joomla 1.5 framework caused a wave of innovative extensions, we believe Nooku Framework is going to cause a shift: It changes how you **create and use extension**s, how extensions work **with each other or with external data**, and how you **customize extensions**. We’ll show you some of the promising Nooku-powered extensions that are being built right now.

### Programmer Rockstars only

On the third day, we’re doing an **exclusive three hour **[**Nooku Framework Workshop**][4]. This is your chance to dive into the API that will revolutionize the way you think about code.

Maybe you **still think that plain Joomla is all you’ll ever need**? Can you know for sure without having seen Nooku in action? We invite you to **open your mind** and find out for yourself. If you don&#8217;t like Nooku after the first half of the workshop, you’re free to leave. No hard feelings!

[Get your tickets now][5]! The [agenda][6] was announced last week and it’s full of interesting talks, and [everybody who’s anybody will be there][7]!
