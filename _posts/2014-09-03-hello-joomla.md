Today we are extremely proud to release our new Nooku site. More then [6 years ago](http://www.nooku.org/blog/2008/04/party-time-%E2%80%94-website-launch/) we set out to create a multi-lingual extension for [Joomla](http://www.joomla.org), a year later we [launched Nooku Framework](http://www.nooku.org/blog/2009/05/nooku-framework-the-api-that-speaks-for-itself/) to help developers create custom Joomla extensions.

In September 2012, and after 3 years of hard work [Nooku Framework 1.0](https://github.com/nooku/nooku-framework/releases) stable was released with support for Joomla 1.5, 2.5 and 3.x.

Last summer we started development on [Nooku Framework 2.0](https://github.com/nooku/nooku-framework). Support for Joomla 1.5 was dropped and the framework has gotten a complete refactor to make the architecture even leaner. One year, [2500 commits](https://github.com/nooku/nooku-framework/graphs/contributors), 2000+ man hours, and many cups of coffee later we are ready!

Nooku Framework 2.0 will be released in the coming days. Together with the new site we are also launching our [developer guides](http://guides.nooku.org) and [API reference](http://api.nooku.org) for Nooku Framework 2.0.

Big kudos goes to all [Timble developers](http://www.timble.net/about/#our-team) and Nooku contributors who have worked on Nooku in the past 6 years! Thank you!

Happy coding!
