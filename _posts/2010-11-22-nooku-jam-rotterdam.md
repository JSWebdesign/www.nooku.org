Together with our friends from the [Dutch Joomla community][1] we are organizing our first Nooku Jam in Rotterdam, NL on the** 11 of December **. If you are a Joomla or PHP developer looking to learn how to build better Joomla extensions faster you don’t want to miss this.

[ Nooku Framework][2] is considered by many as one of the most interesting developments in the Joomlasphere of the last year. Not only because of the **spectacular code reduction** (up to 80% in some cases), but also for the many features that were previously unavailable to Joomla developers:

*   Near-zero-code HMVC
*   REST support
*   Object Relational Mapping
*   Out of the box security features
*   Extensibility through CoC, DI, …

And not to forget **extreme re-usability**: already a number of extensions are being built that can be plugged right into your own, such as user, versioning, trash and taxonomy (tagging and categories) management.

The Nooku Jam Rotterdam will take place on the **11th of December **at the **Brasserie Dylans **from **9:30 until 17:30.** Entrance is free for everyone. We have only **20** **spots** available, so[ **register fast!**][3]

### What can you expect?

A Nooku Jam is very much a hands-on event. It&#8221;s a “participatory [unconference][4]”. The idea is that everyone who comes takes part in some way: that might be running a session, taking photos, blogging, tweeting etc. So don&#8217;t forget to bring your laptop, camera, your questions, ideas, and if you want you can prepare a small presentation yourself.

### Can’t make it ?

Don’t worry, we’re planning more Jams in the near future. In the mean time, if you want to get your hands dirty you check out our public SVN which is available through the Nooku Developer Portal at [http://code.nooku.org][5] For more info on getting started make sure to check out the getting Started information on our [wiki][6].

### Organizing your own jam ?

Organize a Nooku Jam yourself? All you need is a venue that can hold about 15 – 25 people (and if possible an extra room for breakout sessions), wifi and a projector.  [Get in touch][7] for more information.
