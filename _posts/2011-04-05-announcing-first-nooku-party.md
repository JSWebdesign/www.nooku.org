    Joomla and the Knight of Open Source are putting up camp in Kerkrade, Netherlands on the 6-8 May for the second edition of <a href="http://jandbeyond.org/">J! And Beyond</a>.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    J! And Beyond is an community driven International Joomla Conference, which grew out of the vibrant community site <a href="http://www.alltogetherasawhole.org/">All Together As A Whole</a>. We’re proud that <a href="http://jandbeyond.org/sponsors.html">Nooku is once again sponsoring</a>. This is the Joomla community event of the year, you don’t want to miss it!
  </p>
  
  <h3>
    Throwing a party
  </h3>
  
  <p>
    On of the things that made the first edition so special was the great atmosphere and camaraderie by all attendees. With a very international crowed coming to J and Beyond 2011 we thought it to be great to throw a little <strong>pre-event party </strong>on <strong>Thursday 5 May</strong> so that everyone could get the know each other in person before diving in on the 6th.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    We could just all meetup in the bar or go to a restaurant. We wouldn’t be Nooku if we didn’t try to organise something, well a little bit more special. So … we are <strong>going skiing</strong>!
  </p>

  <h3>
    Party programme
  </h3>
  
  <p>
    You read that right! Not even a 10 minutes drive from the J and Beyond venue lies <a href="http://www.snowworld.com/">SnowWorld</a>, the largest indoor ski-slope in Europe, total length of 520m.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    We will be gathering at Snowworld around <strong>17:00</strong>. You can enjoy a <strong>drink in the bar</strong>. At <strong>18:00</strong> we will have <strong>dinner</strong> in one of the restaurants of SnowWorld which has been specially reserved for us. On the menu is a <strong>3 course buffet with Swiss specialities</strong> (food, fish and vegetarian choices) and some nice desserts afterwards.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    At<strong> 20:00</strong> we will hit the slopes for those who want to do a little bit of <strong>skiing</strong>, or you can go straight to the <strong>Apres-ski bar</strong>. Thursdays is party night at SnowWorld, with music in the ski hal and a DJ.
  </p>
