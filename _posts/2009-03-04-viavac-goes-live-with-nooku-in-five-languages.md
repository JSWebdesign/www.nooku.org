Today we heard the exciting news that [Viavac][1], a Dutch company that does business in the Netherlands, Germany, Poland, Belgium, France, Spain, Austria, UK and Ireland, just went live with a [new website][2] that offers users the ability to interact in five languages including English, French, German, Polish & Turkish. Naturally, the site is powered by Nooku Content.

The site was built by one of our Nooku Content partners, [One Company][3], who did the technical implementation and initial content set-up. Viavac (the Customer) did all of the content translation themselves using Nooku Content.

If you want to offer Nooku Content to your clients and help them sell their products and services in local languages around the world, [sign-up][4] to be a Nooku partner.
