<p>“Minihouse provides software solutions to help companies all across Europe with managing import and export activities”, says Rene Kreijveld from One-Company. “To expand their sales efforts outside the Netherlands, they needed a site that could easily communicate their solutions to Dutch, English, French and German speakers.”  Minihouse realised that to be able to do business across Europe a multi-lingual website was top priority.</p>

<p>“We deployed Nooku Content easily through Joomla’s installer, added the languages, and got it up and running in no time. But our biggest challenge when working with clients, is getting them trained on new applications. With Nooku Content we had no such worries. It integrates seamlessly with Joomla sites. The client didn’t have to learn a new user interface. We only had to give them one day of Joomla training — and less than 30 minutes was spent on Nooku Content!”</p>

<p>Minihouse were delighted to see how easy it is for their users: soon they were adding, editing and translating content as if they’ve done it their whole lives. Kreijveld: “Put it this way: my main contact now is their head of marketing!”</p>

<p><a href="http://www.one-company.nl/" target="_blank">One-Company</a> builds and hosts open source CMS-based websites, most of them built on Joomla. “Today more and more of our clients are running multi-language websites. We needed a native Joomla 1.5 extension that was professionally developed, by people who understand Joomla completely. We experimented with Joomfish, but we didn’t like it’s counter-intuitive user interface and complex configuration options. After hearing about Nooku Content, we got in touch to see a live demo. We tested Nooku Content thouroughly before using it for the Minihouse website, and we are convinced that it’s the best solution for Joomla content translation,” Kreijveld concludes. “We are excited to be able to support the Nooku team.”</p>
