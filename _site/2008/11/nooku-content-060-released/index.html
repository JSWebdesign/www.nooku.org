<p>Having a multi-lingual Joomla site is all about broadening your audience. By addressing visitors in their native language, you can reach more people than ever before. But are they really finding you, when they search for your service or product? They will if you use Nooku Content. We believe that content translation and search engine optimization go hand in hand. this week, we released Nooku Content 0.6.0 to our partner network, with some exciting new SEO features.</p>

<h3 id="great-looking-url8217s">Great looking URL’s</h3>

<p>Until now, the choices were limited for Search Engine Friendly URL’s. By default Joomla URL’s have id’s in them, which makes them messy, and hard to remember. Adding third party SEF extensions to your Joomla! 1.5 site often comes with unacceptable performance losses. With Nooku Content 0.6, you can now have clean URL’s out of the box. No id information, no noise and no performance loss.</p>

<h3 id="metadata-where-it-belongs">Metadata where it belongs</h3>

<p>Your articles deserve a description and keywords, but so does every other page on your site. Global metadata, that gets repeated on every page, won’t cut it — search engines expect more than that! That’s why Nooku Content 0.6 now allows you to add metadata for each menu item in your site, and deals with article metadata in more transparent and flexible way.</p>

<h3 id="translate-everything">Translate everything</h3>

<p>Google has localized versions for most countries. For example, Google.fr will give higher priority to sites written in French. That’s why it’s important to translate not just your content, but also your metadata descriptions and keywords, and your URL’s. With Nooku Content 0.6 everything on your page is now translatable. No exceptions.</p>

<h3 id="works-without-worries">Works without worries</h3>

<p>Nooku Content is designed to be invisible most of the time. You don’t need to spend hours setting it up, reading documentation, or teaching your employees how to use it. All the complexity that comes with traditional multi-lingual applications, is handled smoothly in the background. When you do see Nooku Content, it’s integrated in the familiar Joomla user interface. Even though Nooku Content  installs like any regular extension, it feels like it’s always been a part of Joomla.</p>

<p>With the addition of these new features Nooku Content is slowly evolving into a multi-lingual content manager and will not only be off interest to people who are publishing multi-lingual websites. People who are publishing uni-lingual websites will also benefit from the new search engine optimization features in Nooku Content 0.6 and the already great workflow optimizations that Nooku Content 0.5 already offers.</p>
