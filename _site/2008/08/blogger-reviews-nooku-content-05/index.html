<p>As we are giving more people access to demo’s of Nooku Content, we are starting to get some interesting feedback. After doing a little test run with Nooku Content v0.5 on our demo site, X-Ception wrote a <a href="http://x-ceptions.blogspot.com/2008/07/nooku-first-impression.html">review on his blog</a>. Even though Nooku Content is still in in pre-beta, he seemed to like what he saw (and no, we didn’t tell him to write a favourable review!)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>So being offered the chance to play with the hottest yet-to-be publicly released component before most have.. was well shall we say a fat kid with candy.<br />

Translating content is a breeze, it’s again as easy as creating a content item in the first place, you can see all of what’s going on and upon publishing everything is updated so you can move straight onto the next item no more wasting time on these things.</p>

  <p>So along with the screenshots the things that I did notice was:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>It’s fast, very fast</li>
    <li>Informative</li>
    <li>Easy, very easy</li>
    <li>Does what it says it will do</li>
    <li>Flexible</li>
  </ul>

<p>UPDATE : A <a title="Nooku translation extension for joomla - review" href="http://x-ceptions.blogspot.com/2008/09/nooku-second-review.html" target="_blank">second review</a> was added recently.<br />
