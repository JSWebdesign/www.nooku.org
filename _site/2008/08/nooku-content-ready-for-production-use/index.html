This is possible thanks to our <a title="Agile development at the Joomlatools blog" href="http://blog.joomlatools.eu/2008/02/open-development-approach.html" target="_blank">agile development approach</a>: every couple of weeks we release a new version of Nooku Content. These releases are not feature complete, but what is in there is working, and can be deployed on a live site.</p>

<p>In the ‘classic’ development model, you sometimes work for more then a  year on an application that, when done, turns out not to fit the needs of the user entirely. One of the benefits of the agile methodology is that you get real world feed back right away. That feedback can immediately be used to steer development and decide on the feature set for the next release.</p>

<p>Of course, every now and then bugs creep in the code. To ensure our partners can keep their Nooku sites stable and secure, we’ve started doing mid point  maintenance releases. For example, today we released 0.5.2. This is a maintenance release for 0.5 and is fully backwards compatible with 0.5.0. In the meantime, we are also working on new features for 0.6. This approach gives our partners the ability to use Nooku Content in a production site and be confident it will keep working.</p>
