<p>A couple of weeks ago we sent a survey to the subscribers of our Nooku newsletter asking the community to tell us a bit about themselves, how they use Joomla and also help us with planning the roadmap for Nooku Content. We got a great response to <a href="http://www.polldaddy.com/s/758FAEA0AC0FEDB5/">the survey</a> and wanted to share some of the results with you. By the way, you can still fill out the survey by clicking <a href="http://www.polldaddy.com/s/758FAEA0AC0FEDB5/">here</a></p>

<h3 id="about-you">About You</h3>

<ul>
  <li>More than 90% of you build websites</li>
  <li>Nearly 50% of you integrate software applications</li>
  <li>The average price charged for a website build is almost $5,000</li>
  <li>A number of you work in companies with over 100 employees.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="multi-lingual-needs">Multi-Lingual Needs</h3>

<ul>
  <li>More than 75% of our readers need to build customer websites in more than one language</li>
  <li>Nearly 50% say the majority of your customers need multi-lingual sites</li>
  <li>Less than 33% say that only a small number of customers want sites in more than one language.</li>
</ul>

<p>Note: This might be biased by the fact that people reading about Nooku are interested in the multi-lingual web.</p>

<h3 id="professional-applications">Professional Applications</h3>

<p>We left plenty of open space in the survey to allow readers to tell us what struggles they had working with Joomla and also where we could help in the future. Below are some common replies.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Many of you complained about the quality of free extensions available for Joomla websites.</li>
  <li>Quite a few of you commented that often the extensions did not work properly, were not easily extendable or customisable to your needs and generally resulted in poor results.</li>
  <li>We noticed quite a few of you telling us that your customers now want their Joomla websites integrated with existing software applications.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="what-happens-next">What Happens Next?</h3>

<p>We are in the midst of planing the features for Nooku Content 0.6. Please stay tuned as details will become available in the next Nooku newsletter! If you have not signed up for the newsletter, you can do so <a href="en/buzz/nooku-newsletter.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>Once again, thanks for spending time telling us how we can help you do better with Joomla!</p>
