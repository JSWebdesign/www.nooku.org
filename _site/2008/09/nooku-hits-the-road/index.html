<p>Last week we were invited by <a href="http://www.eduvision.nl/joomla.html" title="Eduvision">Eduvision</a> to their <a href="http://www.eduvision.nl/joomlaconferentie/conf2008.html" title="annual Joomla! Conference">annual Joomla! Conference</a> to talk about setting up a multi-lingual website with Nooku Content and Joomla! 1.5.</p>

<p>During our presentation we touched on the how’s and why’s of multi-lingual websites and demo’ed <a href="index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=70:nooku-ready-for-production-use&amp;Itemid=50">Nooku Content 0.5</a>.</p>

<p>The overall feedback from the crowd was very positive. People were excited about the many advantages Nooku Content offers over existing multi-lingual solutions in areas like usability, simplicity, performance etc …</p>

<p>Also, we were pleasantly surprised to hear how much people appreciated our effort to not only create a next generation multi-language solution for Joomla!, but also to demonstrate that a funded business model can be a great way to create GPL’ed solutions in true spirit of the licence.</p>
