<blockquote>
  <p>“Hold on, I can hear you think, what about the language specific URLs? Strange formed URLs, Not translated Titles, not translated Meta-tags like descriptions, keywords etc etc…</p>

  <p>Now this is where Johan and Mathias really impressed me!</p>

  <p>(…) The title that was translated was indeed translated also in the HTML Title, but also the URL itself was automatically rewritten to that language title version.<br />
You also get the possibility to translate your meta tag description and keywords into the translated version… so you really get a translated version of a content page in a really Search Engine Optimized way.”</p>
