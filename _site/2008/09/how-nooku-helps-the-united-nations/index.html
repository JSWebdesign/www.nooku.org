<p>The United Nations has gone live with its <a href="http://html.knowyourrights2008.org">first Nooku Content powered site</a>. They first got in touch with us in January 2008 when they were looking for a professional multi-lingual solution to migrate their <a href="http://www.unric.org">European portal</a> to Joomla 1.5.</p>

<p>“We evaluated many open source software solutions and found Joomla to be the best for us,” says Philippe Chabot, ICT coordinator at the United Nations. “When we looked at our two options, Drupal did not perform as well as Joomla. Now that we have a lot of experience with Joomla we are no longer looking at other applications. Of course, from time to time, for risk management best practices we will evaluate all available options.”</p>

<p>“In the previous version of our <a href="http://www.unric.org">European portal</a>, we used a free extension called Joomfish,” says Chabot, “but with our new Joomla 1.5 website we needed something that could handle our requirements in terms of performance and usability.”</p>

<p>And a big organization has big requirements: the UN is running an <a href="http://www.unric.org/">information portal in 13 languages</a>, with a European audience that averages 50,000 monthly visitors and delivers over 5 million page views a month.</p>

<p>“Before migrating more than 30.000 articles and translations into a new version of the entire site using Nooku, we decided to run a test case. We used Nooku Content for a campaign we have developed called ‘Know Your Rights’, for the 60th anniversary of the Human Rights Declaration.” The site can be found at <a href="http://html.knowyourrights2008.org/">http://html.knowyourrights2008.org/</a> .</p>

<p>The site was built internally, but with some help from an external designer with experience working with Joomla. There are three staff members running &amp; maintaining the site, but none of them are developers!</p>

<p>“We found working with Nooku Content extremely easy and straightforward. Nooku Content also offers a lot of reporting and graphs, that we haven’t even fully explored yet!” When asked what he likes best about Nooku Content , Philippe Chabot replied: “Its seamless integration into Joomla and the outstanding performance make it a great solution for high performing multilingual websites.”</p>
