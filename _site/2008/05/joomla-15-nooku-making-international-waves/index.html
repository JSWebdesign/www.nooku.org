<p>We recently exhibited at a technology show in London where there was a lot of interest about Joomla combined with Nooku Content.  This was a real milestone because the show was mainly attended by software vendors providing proprietary solutions.   Two members of Joomlatools left the stand to conduct a quick ‘survey’.   What they discovered was that out in enterprise-land there is very few comparable CMSs (Content Management Systems) as flexible or as powerful as Joomla! 1.5 and light years away from what can be achieved with 1.5 and Nooku Content combined.</p>
