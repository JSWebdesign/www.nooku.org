<p>Following a very successful <a href="http://blog.nooku.org/2010/10/jamming-in-manila-with-nooku/">Nooku Jam Manila in 2010</a>, Johan is back to give developers  another whirlwind experience with the Nooku Framework. Israel and Myra, Timble’s Manila team, will also be around to help facilitate the event.</p>

<p>Nooku Jam Manila will be held on <strong>Friday, November 4, 2011</strong> at the <strong><a href="http://www.exist.com/">Exist</a> TechBar in Ortigas, Metro Manila</strong>. If you are a passionate Joomla/PHP developer, join us for a day of technology, hacking and fun. And the hard work will pay off at the after party at the end of the day to start the celebrations for a great Nooku year.</p>

<p>The techbar can only hosts <strong>20 developers. **We expect to sell out quick so make sure to **<a href="http://nj11manilla.eventbrite.com/">register early</a></strong>!</p>

<p>With the Nooku headquarters just a few miles away, the Nooku Jam almost comes home on the <strong>26-27th of November in Leuven, Belgium</strong>. Our friends from <a href="http://www.flandersdc.be/en"><strong>FlandersDC</strong></a> will host the Jam in their uber awesome <a href="http://www.flandersdc.be/en/services/creativity-lab"><strong>Creativity Lab</strong></a> which will be opened for us specially during the weekend.</p>

<p>Except not one day, but a full weekend of intense presentations, discussions, brainstorms, workshops, hackathons, … around specific areas of the Nooku project. And offcourse in good Nooku tradition there will be a Nooku Party!</p>

<p>This Jam is a great opportunity for Nookuers to meet in person, to put a face on a lot of quirky mailing list and IM nicknames, and to spend some quality time together!</p>

<p>The Nooku Jam is organised together with community partners (<a href="http://www.timble.net">Timble</a>, <a href="http://moyoweb.nl/">MoyoWeb</a>, <a href="http://www.pincoding.com/">Pincoding</a>, <a href="http://beyounic.com/">Beyounic</a>, <a href="http://www.flandersdc.be/en">FlandersDC</a>). We are still looking for companies to help sponsor the event. Interested? <a href="http://www.nooku.org/about/contact.html">Get in touch</a>.</p>
