<p><em>This is a guest post from Jelle Munk, of <a href="http://www.stoeldemunk.nl/">Stoel de Munk</a>, attendee of the Nooku Jam Leuven 2011.</em></p>

<p>I was a web developer who worked anonymously behind my desk using open source software but I did not like where I was going:</p>

<ul>
  <li>I did not share;</li>
  <li>I did not collaborate;</li>
  <li>I did not contribute code.</li>
</ul>

<p>Something had to change, I felt working with free and open source software was more than this.</p>

  Hello Community
</h3>

<p>I heard about the Nooku Framework and <a href="http://vimeo.com/channels/nooku">watched the talks </a>Johan has been giving about the framework. More importantly, what really got my attention was his philosophy about open source development.</p>

<p>I saw an upcoming event called the ‘<a href="http://www.eventbrite.com/event/2326534728">Nooku Jam Leuven</a>‘ and felt it was a good way to force myself to learn more about open source. Taking the next step, I signed up!</p>

<p>But then came the doubts. I just started with component development in Joomla. So wouldn’t it be too difficult? Was I even welcome? Wouldn’t it be better to start with a one day event? But I knew these where all just excuses not to move forward.</p>

  The weekend
</h3>

<p>It turned out to be great! The two days were divided into half hour slots where everyone had the opportunity to do a session. The topic of the sessions ranged from a brainstorm for a new re-usable extension, the future development of the Nooku Framework to just showing of some code.</p>

<p>We also had a CMS showdown comparing three different systems and shared the productivity tools we were all using. And last but not least was meeting face to face with other developers (while consuming great Belgian beers and food).</p>

<p>It was inspiring, educational, but above all, lots of fun. So to all developers sitting silently behind their desks, it’s much more fun if you start sharing and collaborating!</p>

<p>And to all the participants I met in Leuven, thanks for the wonderful time.</p>

<p>Happy coding!</p>
