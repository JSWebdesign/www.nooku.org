    Following up on the success of the <a href="http://blog.nooku.org/2010/10/jamming-in-manila-with-nooku/">first Asian Nooku Jam in Manila</a> last September 2010. This year’s jam, was held in the heart of one of Metro Manila’s CBDs &#8211; Ortigas, where we were kindly given the run of the TechBar in the headquarters of <a href="http://www.exist.com/">Exist Software Labs</a>.
  </p>

    Jammers from all over
  </h4>
  
  <p>
    Demonstrating the global reach of Nooku, two of our Jammers hailed from the foothills of the gods &#8211; Nepal.  Nischal Pradhan, founder and CEO of a software development firm in Nepal that utilizes Nooku technology, was in Manila when he found out that Mr. Nooku himself was going to be in town, he and some of his team, jumped at the chance to be part of the Jam.

  <p>
    The other 13 Jammers were local Filipino IT professionals mainly working for private commercial companies and the academe.

    Sticky notes
  </h4>
  
  <p>
    The Jam kicked off with a free form sticky note session, where participants wrote questions and ideas they were interested to find out about Nooku. The sticky notes were then posted on a whiteboard and Johan used this to structure the agenda for the day &#8211; very unconference style!

    Keep it DRY, Shy, and Tell the other Guy
  </h4>
  
  <p>
    After a hearty lunch break, the afternoon segment of the Jam delved more deeply into the code itself, looking into the very nuts and bolts of the framework and how to leverage its ‘magic’.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Part of this involved a session led by Israel Canasa that examined the com_activities component he is working on. Rael talked about the <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/factoryjoe/socialism-activity-streams-federating-the-social-web">philosophy</a> of <a href="http://activitystrea.ms/">activity streams</a> giving a real world insight into how Nooku can be used to power development.
  </p>
  
  <h4 dir="ltr">
    Prost!!!
  </h4>
  
  <p>
    As always appropriate after a whole day of Jamming, a good meal and liquid refreshments ;) are called for. So the Nooku team and a few of the Jammers had dinner at a local Filipino resto to share insights in a more social atmosphere.  A perfect way to end a highly productive day.

    Vision to Architecture
  </h4>
  
  <p>
    The Prezi used by Johan to present the vision of Nooku that led to the creation of the architecture behind the framework is <a href="http://prezi.com/y8xf4syr9yrr/nooku-from-vision-to-architecture/">available online here</a>.
