    Past weekend, the Nooku Team was at the <a href="http://joomladagen.nl/">Dutch Joomladays</a>, as both sponsors and speakers. The event sold completely out. Two days with 200 attendees each, that’s a lot of interesting people to meet. Very positive vibe and and superb organisation, one of the best Joomladays I ever attended. A big congrats to everyone who helped to make this happen.

    We have a tradition of showing something new each year at the Dutch Joomladays, so Tom and myself were very proud to officially announce our Nooku Platform and present our<a href="http://prezi.com/n6bdxcskmpks/state-of-nooku-2011/"> second State of Nooku</a>.

    <!--more-->The Year of Nooku Platform
  </h3>
  
  <p>
    2011 will be the year of the Nooku Platform, and with the announcement of Nooku Desktop the Platform is now complete:
  </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Nooku Framework</strong>, rapid extension development framework
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Nooku Server</strong>, multi-site and multi-lingual distribution of Joomla
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Nooku Desktop</strong>, a desktop web application container
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>
    The Nooku Platform allows you to create multi-site web applications, making them available using native desktop apps with nothing more then existing web skills like Javascript, HTML, CSS and PHP.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    With the <a href="http://blog.nooku.org/2011/01/a-roadmap-for-nooku-server/">0.7 alpha releases</a>, Nooku is gearing up for production use. The <strong>0.7 beta due, for May this year</strong> will not be feature-complete — that’s why it’s not a 1.0 release  — but the API’s we are very stable, making it a perfect choice for your next project.

    We love Joomla and we want it to thrive. We want Joomla to have a future, not just a history. With Nooku we are making this happen. As one of our community members told me recently:
  </p>
  
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      We are f/oss developers, we do what we do best : writing code, solving problems and sharing our solutions.

    I recognize that for some, change is difficult. But this is technology! It’s the fastest game in the world! Let’s not fear this process but embrace it for the benefit of everyone.
