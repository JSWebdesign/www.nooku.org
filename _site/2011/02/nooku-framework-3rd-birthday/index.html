<p>Just over three years ago, on 12 February 2008, we made the <a href="http://nooku.assembla.com/code/nooku-framework/subversion/changesets/1">first commit</a> to our beloved Nooku Framework. Today, <a href="http://www.nooku.org/framework.html">Nooku Framework</a> drastically speeds up the creation and maintenance of Joomla extensions while eliminating repetitive coding and adding power, flexibility and fun. Finally, you can focus on what matters most: your extension’s business logic and user experience.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Definition: “to nookify” (verb) : Collaborating to make code reusable, flexible and magical. Often leads to reduction of 60-80% in code.</p>

<h3 id="introducing-nooku-platform">Introducing Nooku Platform</h3>

<p>On the 4th of February 2011, we attended the first ever <a href="http://www.joomlanight.se/">Joomlanight</a> in Stockholm, Sweden. The topic of this event was “Joomla: At The Edge Of Innovation” and hosted three talks:</p>

<ul>
  <li>“The Road Ahead for Joomla!” by Ryan Ozimek</li>
  <li>“Molajo Joomla! 1.6 Distribution” by Marco Barbosa</li>
  <li>“Nooku – Evolving and Innovating Joomla!” by our own Johan Janssens</li>
</ul>

<p>Johan introduced the Nooku Platform, vision, strategy and roadmap:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Nooku Framework, rapid extension development framework</li>
  <li>Nooku Server, multi-site and multi-lingual distribution of Joomla</li>
  <li>Nooku Community, innovative and open source community</li>
</ul>

<p>The event was broadcasted live on the inter-tubes, thanks to Martin Blodau. If you missed it, sit back and enjoy Johan’s talk. We also made the presentation available <a href="http://prezi.com/qhj97qbobseg/the-nooku-platform/">here</a>.<br />

<p><img class="alignleft" title="The Nooku Train" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4031/4536195092_9407942e60_m.jpg" alt="" width="200" /> Earlier this year, we announced a <a href="http://blog.nooku.org/2011/01/a-roadmap-for-nooku-server/">roadmap for Nooku Server</a>. First stop of the Nooku train is <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/nooku-framework/browse_thread/thread/bc8c88a8e81a75c9#">Alpha1 on the 20th of this month</a>. This means that all our public spaces following the 0.7 development cycle: Framework, Server, Components and Examples will be tagged as Alpha1.</p>

<p>But you don’t have to wait! Our <a href="http://code.nooku.org">Nooku Developer Portal</a> gives you easy access to all our public spaces including the latest and hottest Nooku Server space.</p>

<h3 id="community-at-work">Community at work</h3>

<p>Three years ago, we were not much more than a handful of people with a vision. Today, Nooku is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>an active team of 10 people</li>
  <li>20 contributors who signed the <a href="http://blog.nooku.org/2010/11/nooku-contributor-agreement/">Contributor Agreement</a></li>
  <li>360 subscribers in the <a href="http://lists.nooku.org">developer’s discussion group</a></li>
  <li>hundreds of websites powered by Nooku Framework</li>
</ul>

<p>Code metrics are not a good measurement for the size or quality of a project, but they do help to indicate progress. In our official <a href="http://code.nooku.org">repositories</a>, we have almost:</p>

<ul>
  <li>3000 commits for Nooku Framework</li>
  <li>700 commits for Nooku Components</li>
  <li>300 commits for Nooku Examples</li>
  <li>400 commits for Nooku Server</li>
</ul>

<p>Happy 3rd birthday to the Nooku Framework and kudos to our community for driving Nooku towards the edge of innovation!</p>
