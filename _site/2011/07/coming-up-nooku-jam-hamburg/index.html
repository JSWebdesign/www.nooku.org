<p><a href="http://www.nooku.org/framework.html">Nooku Framework</a> is considered by many as one of the most interesting developments in the Joomlasphere of the last year. Not only because of the <strong>spectacular code reduction</strong> (up to 80%), but also for the many features that were previously unavailable to Joomla developers:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Near-zero-code HMVC</li>
  <li>REST support</li>
  <li>Object Relational Mapping</li>
  <li>Out of the box security features</li>
  <li>Extensibility through CoC, DI, Mixins …</li>
  <li>Extreme re-usability</li>
</ul>

<p>Not only are we bringing you a powerful new framework. We’re also working on <strong>Nooku Server</strong>, a multi-site Joomla 1.5 distribution. During the Jam we will reveal some amazing <strong>secrets</strong> of <a href="http://blog.nooku.org/2011/07/2000-reasons-to-celebrate/">Nooku Server Alpha3</a>, released on the 1st of July.</p>

<h3 id="what-can-you-expect">What can you expect?</h3>

<p>A Nooku Jam is very much a hands-on event. It’s a “participatory <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconference">unconference</a>”, so you, the attendees are going to be making the event as great as it can be. The idea is that everyone who comes takes part in some way: that might be running a session, taking photos, blogging, tweeting etc.</p>

<p>So don’t forget to bring your laptop, camera, your questions, ideas, and if you want you can prepare a small presentation yourself.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.nooku.org/2010/12/how-i-became-a-nooku-contributor/">Christian Hent</a> will be among the Jammers. He’s Captain of <a href="http://www.assembla.com/spaces/nooku-examples/wiki/com_harbour">com_harbour</a>, Nooku’s example component. If you want to dive into the Harbour code, this is your chance to do it under the guidance of its Captain.</p>

<p><em>“The code is more what you’d call “guidelines” than actual rules.”</em></p>
