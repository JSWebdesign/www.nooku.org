  What can you expect

<p>The Nooku Jam is for Joomla and PHP developers looking to learn how to build better Joomla extensions faster. It is an opportunity to get down and dirty with the Nooku Framework.</p>

<p>Not only are we bringing you a powerful new framework. We’re also working on Nooku Server, a multi-site Joomla 1.5 distribution. During the Jam, we will reveal some amazing secrets of <a href="http://blog.nooku.org/2011/07/2000-reasons-to-celebrate/">Nooku Server Alpha 3</a>, released on the 1st of July, and take a sneak peak into work being done for Alpha 4.</p>
