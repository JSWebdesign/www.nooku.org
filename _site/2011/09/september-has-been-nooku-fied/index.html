<p>Two Nooku jams, two continents, one weekend! September was off to a great start start when Johan attended Joomladay Brazil, Tom attended Joomladay Hamburg and magic happened.</p>

  Nooku Jam Florianopolis
</h3>

<p>The Jam started at 6PM right after the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJg7Mb3FnVM&amp;NR=1">closing video of the Joomladay Brazil</a>. Johan rounded up a crew of 35 brave developers who were eager to stick around and all excited to dive into Nooku Framework. With most of the participants being new to Nooku, Johan focused the Jam on showing how easy it is to build a Joomla extension with Nooku Framework.</p>

</p>

<p>Johan started by demonstrating how you can create a fully working RESTful webservice with Nooku Framework with just one line of code. This set the tone for what was to follow. In the next 90 minutes, he built a fully working <a href="https://nooku.assembla.com/spaces/nooku-examples/wiki/com_tada">todo list component</a> with tagging, logging, and versioning support.</p>

<p>At the end of the Jam, Johan answered questions and there was an interesting discussion about performance and coding patterns followed with of course the usual round of beer(s)!</p>

<p>The Nooku Jam was recorded by <a href="http://twitter.com/fititnt">Emerson Rocha Luiz</a>. You can find the video on the <a href="http://vimeo.com/channels/nooku#28894317">Nooku TV channel on vimeo</a>. Thanks Emerson!</p>

  Nooku Jam Hamburg
</h3>

<p>Now over in Germany, Tom got a bunch of people to do presentations, hacking, and coding. There were folks from the Dutch Joomla community who came to Hamburg especially for the Nooku Jam.</p>

<p><a href="http://twitter.com/#!/christianhent">Christian Hent </a>(captain of com_harbour) now nicknamed  ’El Capitano’ as a result of the Jam, <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/inwend">Stefan Wendhausen</a> &amp; <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/SniperSister">David Jardin</a> (co-organizers of the Joomladay itself) were also present. The Jam was the perfect venue for people to show off Nooku powered stuff they created and help each other improve their code.</p>

</p>

<p>One of those little beauties is a document management solution built by <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/SniperSister">David Jardin</a> for a university. The application allowed people to upload notes they took during a class, then share them with other people and most importantly collaborate with them on that file. The university initially used Dropbox but it was missing features to optimize collaboration, so he created something himself in Nooku Server.</p>

<p>See you on the next Nooku Jam. Your city might be nooku-fied next!</p>
