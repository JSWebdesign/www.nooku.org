<p>Just a little while ago we passed the <a href="http://nooku.assembla.com/code/nooku-framework/subversion/changesets/2500">2500 commits mark</a> in our Nooku Framework SVN. With all the work being done this little milestone almost slipped under the radar. Time for a little celebration!</p>

<p>Some facts. When we made the Nooku Framework codebase available on Sourceforge <a href="http://blog.nooku.org/2009/08/nooku-framework-goes-sourceforge/">a little over a year ago</a> the commit counter was at 1218. Today with all <a href="http://nooku.assembla.com/">spaces</a> combined we are nearing 3250 commits, that’s 2000 commits in one year. Amazing  !</p>

<p>Nooku is slowly earning it’s spot with the big boys as you can see from the graph (taken from <a href="http://www.ohloh.net)">Ohloh</a>) below. Not bad huh !</p>

<p>We said it already last April : <a href="http:// blog.nooku.org/2010/04/the-state-of-nooku/#more-194">2010 is the year of the Nooku Community</a> and what a year it has been so far. We <a href="http://blog.nooku.org/2010/04/nooku-developer-portal-opens-doors/">launched</a> our Nooku Developer Portal, opened up our <a href="http://lists.nooku.org">mailing list </a>for public read-access and saw our little community grow to more then then 300 registered developers. Not less then 15 developers have contributed code so far : <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=D&amp;q=https://www.ohloh.net/p/nooku-framework/contributors%3Fpage%3D1&amp;usg=AFQjCNEuKG3Z5_YQ4Flc8rX9Aaozt4MHmQ" target="_blank">https://www.ohloh.net/p/nooku-framework/contributors</a></p>

<p>Big thanks to all of them, for their contributions, feedback, suggestions, ideas … and above all for making Nooku a fun place to work together with others.</p>

<h3 id="what8217s-next-">What’s next ?</h3>

<p>The year isn’t over yet ! We are in final stages of setting up our <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/nooku-framework/browse_thread/thread/8d30f285d23490b8/eb83f881efe41dac">Nooku Incubator program</a>. The incubator will be ‘the’ place for developers to collaborate with each other and work on innovative ideas.</p>

<p>In order to ensure that everyone has the same understanding of and commitment to the project when they choose to participate in the Nooku Incubator Program we are in process of creating a Nooku Contributor Agreement. A draft is currently being reviewed by key contributors. Feedback has been very positive.</p>
