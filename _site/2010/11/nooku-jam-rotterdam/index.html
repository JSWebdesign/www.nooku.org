<p>Together with our friends from the <a href="http://www.joomlacommunity.eu/">Dutch Joomla community</a> we are organizing our first Nooku Jam in Rotterdam, NL on the** 11 of December **. If you are a Joomla or PHP developer looking to learn how to build better Joomla extensions faster you don’t want to miss this.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.nooku.org/framework"> Nooku Framework</a> is considered by many as one of the most interesting developments in the Joomlasphere of the last year. Not only because of the <strong>spectacular code reduction</strong> (up to 80% in some cases), but also for the many features that were previously unavailable to Joomla developers:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Near-zero-code HMVC</li>
  <li>REST support</li>
  <li>Object Relational Mapping</li>
  <li>Out of the box security features</li>
  <li>Extensibility through CoC, DI, …</li>
</ul>

<p>And not to forget <strong>extreme re-usability</strong>: already a number of extensions are being built that can be plugged right into your own, such as user, versioning, trash and taxonomy (tagging and categories) management.</p>

<p>The Nooku Jam Rotterdam will take place on the <strong>11th of December **at the **Brasserie Dylans **from **9:30 until 17:30.</strong> Entrance is free for everyone. We have only <strong>20</strong> <strong>spots</strong> available, so<a href="http://nj10ro.eventbrite.com"> <strong>register fast!</strong></a><br />

<p>A Nooku Jam is very much a hands-on event. It”s a “participatory <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconference">unconference</a>”. The idea is that everyone who comes takes part in some way: that might be running a session, taking photos, blogging, tweeting etc. So don’t forget to bring your laptop, camera, your questions, ideas, and if you want you can prepare a small presentation yourself.</p>
