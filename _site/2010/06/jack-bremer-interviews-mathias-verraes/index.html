<p>During our three days at <a href="http://jandbeyond.com">J! And Beyond</a>, the International Joomla Conference, I was interviewed about Nooku Framework. Jack Bremer did an excellent job (it’s hard to believe he’s not a professional interviewer!)</p>

<p>We talked about the growing Nooku Community and the origins of <a href="http://nooku.org/content">Nooku Content</a> and <a href="http://nooku.org/framework">Nooku Framework</a>. In the middle it gets a bit technical, but hold on, after that there’s some fun stuff about the Joomlasphere’s obsession with Swahili names.</p>

<p>The interview was taped by Zohar Babin. He was at J! And Beyond in his role as Director of Developer Relations and Community for <a href="http://corp.kaltura.com">Kaltura</a>, the open source video platform, as they were sponsoring the event. Zohar decided to take the opportunity to learn more about Joomla, by interviewing a number of people in the community. I’m proud to have been one of them. Check out his technology blog for more interviews <a href="http://www.zoharbabin.com/j-and-beyond-first-day-interviews">here</a> and <a href="http://www.zoharbabin.com/j-and-beyond-second-and-third-day-interviews-recap">here</a>.</p>

<p>Jack Bremer, the interviewer, runs <a href="http://www.3bweb.com/">3B Digital</a> in London, a full-service digital marketing agency who specialise in Joomla projects, SEO and social media.</p>
