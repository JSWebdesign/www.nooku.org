<p>Development of <a href="http://blog.nooku.org/2010/12/nooku-server-joomla-on-steroids/">Nooku Server</a> is blazing ahead. Integration of the multi-site features has started. If all goes as planned we should be able to demo a first workable version on our u<a href="http://blog.nooku.org/2010/11/nooku-jam-rotterdam/">pcoming Nooku Jam in Rotterdam</a> this weekend.</p>

<p>At Nooku we pride ourselves by doing more with less. And when we mean less we mean a lot less, as<a href="http://blog.nooku.org/2010/12/ajax-widgets-with-nooku-framework/"> Stian nicely demostrated</a> in his latest blog post. <br />
Joomla 1.5 counts nearly 300k lines of code. That’s a lot of code ! Before we start improving Nooku Server, we would like to cut away any unused features.</p>

<p>To do that we need your help. We are curious to find out which Joomla core extensions you are using, and more importantly what features you are not using. If you have a moment please fill out our little form below and let us know. Thanks !<br />
