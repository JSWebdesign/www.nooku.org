<p>We are pleased to announce the release of <a href="http://www.nooku.org/content">Nooku Content</a> version 0.6.8. This version is a maintenance release that addresses a regression issue introduced in the 0.6.7 release.</p>

<p>This release also includes the following fixes :</p>

<ul>
  <li>Fixed redirection issues in the administrator when switching language after using the items view.</li>
  <li>Fixed problem when trying to delete existing or none-existing tables</li>
  <li>Fixed issue with custom flags not being rendered properly</li>
</ul>

<p>We also introduced <strong>front-end user language support</strong>. When trying to determine the preferred language Nooku Content now takes the frontend language setting into account for logged in users. The new sequence is : session -&gt; cookie -&gt; user (only if logged in) -&gt; browser -&gt; primary.</p>

<p>Together with the release of Nooku Content 0.6.8 we are also releasing Nooku Framework 0.6.8 which includes a number of smaller fixes. Nooku Framework is available through our <a href="http://code.nooku.org">Nooku Developer Portal</a>, for a direct link to the 0.6.8 SVN go <a href="http://nooku.assembla.com/code/nooku-framework/subversion/nodes/tags">here</a>.</p>
