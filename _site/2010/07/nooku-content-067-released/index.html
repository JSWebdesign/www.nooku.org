<p>We are pleased to announce the release of <a href="http://www.nooku.org/content">Nooku Content</a> version 0.6.7. This version is a maintenance release that addresses a number of issues reported by our partners. A few smaller features where also added :</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Module translation improvements.</strong> We have further optimized the way Nooku Content deals with syncing of module translations and improved Nooku Content’s module translation workflow. Modules are no longer listed in the items overview and are also no longer taken into account for the statistics.</li>
  <li><strong>Improved compatibility with K2</strong>. We have done extensive testing with K2 and fixed a number of smaller issues related to translating a K2 powered Joomla site. We are happy to announce that we now fully support K2.</li>
</ul>

<p>Together with the release of Nooku Content 0.6.7 we are also releasing Nooku Framework 0.6.7 which includes a number of smaller fixes. Nooku Framework is available through our <a href="http://code.nooku.org">Nooku Developer Portal</a>, for a direct link to the 0.6.7 SVN go <a href="http://nooku.assembla.com/code/nooku-framework/subversion/nodes/tags">here</a>.</p>
