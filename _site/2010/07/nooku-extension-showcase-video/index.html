<p>More and more Joomla developers are starting to use Nooku Framework for building powerful, extendible and secure Joomla extensions. The <a href="http://nekkidninjas.com/index.php/2010/07/26/ninjaboard-beta5-drops-from-the-sky">first</a> <a href="http://blog.anahitapolis.com/2010/05/anahita-the-alpha-girl-in-the-social-networking-universe/">generation</a> of <a href="http://blog.ohanah.com/?p=109">extensions</a> is in beta and more extensions are being worked.</p>

<p>Just like the Joomla 1.5 framework caused a wave of innovative extensions, we believe Nooku Framework is going to cause a shift: It changes how you <strong>create and use extension</strong>s, how extensions work <strong>with each other or with external data</strong>, and how you <strong>customize extensions</strong>.</p>

<p>At <a href="http://www.jandbeyond.org">J! and Beyond 2010</a> we, together with some of our Nooku Community Contributors and Partners showed some of the promising Nooku-powered extensions that are being built right now. Check out the video and take a sneak peek into Joomla’s future !</p>
