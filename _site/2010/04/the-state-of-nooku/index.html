<p>Last week, the Nooku Team was at the <a href="http://joomladagen.nl">Dutch Joomladays</a>, as both sponsors and speakers. There was a great turnout, the positive vibe and everybody was genuinely excited about the amazing innovations the Joomlasphere has come up with in the past year.</p>

<p>We have a tradition of showing something new each year at the Dutch Joomladays, so Johan and myself were very proud to officially announce our <a href="http://code.nooku.org">Developer Portal</a> and present our very first State of Nooku.</p>

<p>2010 is the year of you, the community! With the upcoming 0.7 beta releases, we feel Nooku Framework is growing up significantly. It’s not feature-complete — that’s why it’s not a 1.0 release yet. But the features we do have are getting very stable, making it a perfect choice for your next project.</p>

<p>2010 is the year of the Nooku Community, and we’ve announced new resources to help you build Nooku-powered extensions. The <a href="http://code.nooku.org">Nooku Developer Portal</a> is the first place to go: you can find the code, the bug tracker and activity streams. The spaces for Components, Examples and Tools give room to developers to experiment, play and contribute. We’ve made the <a href="http://lists.nooku.org">mailing list</a> public, as well as the <a href="http://wiki.nooku.org">community-maintained wiki</a>.</p>

<h2 id="contributions">Contributions</h2>

<p>We’re seeing some very cool contributions from the community: <a href="http://nooku.assembla.com/profile/christianhent">Christian</a> is building an extended version of the <a href="http://nooku.assembla.com/wiki/show/nooku-examples/com_harbour">com_harbour</a> example component, <a href="http://nooku.assembla.com/profile/torkiljohnsen">Torkil</a> is working on <a href="http://nooku.assembla.com/wiki/show/nooku-components/com_versions">versioning</a>, <a href="http://nooku.assembla.com/profile/stiandidriksen">Stian</a> wrote an amazing <a href="http://nooku.assembla.com/wiki/show/nooku-components/com_koowa">auto-updater</a> for the framework, Steven did a proof of concept for a webhooks component, and the list goes on. And let’s not forget everybody who submitted bug reports and patches, edited the wiki, and helped newcomers on the <a href="http://lists.nooku.org">mailing list</a>.</p>
