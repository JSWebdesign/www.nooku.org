<p>We are pleased to announce the release of <a href="http://www.nooku.org/content">Nooku Content</a> version 0.6.6. This version is a bug fix release that addresses a number of issues that where reported by our partners. A few smaller features where also added :</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Better language syncing</strong>. We have made a number of changes to the way Nooku Content handles it’s language syncing especially during installation of extensions. Nooku Content is now smart enough to sync modules that are installed as part of the installation of a packaged extension. For example, DOCman, or K2, etc ..</li>
  <li><strong>Better error handling</strong>. We re-worked our error handling to throw nice and meaning-full error messages when something goes wrong, for example when a language cannot be found.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you want to see Nooku Content in action, you can find our team this weekend at the<a href="http://blog.nooku.org/2010/05/special-treat-at-j-and-beyond/"> J and Beyond conference</a> We are sponsoring the event and are also doing a Nooku Framework workshop on Tuesday.</p>
