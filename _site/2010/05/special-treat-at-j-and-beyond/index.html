And Beyond, the international Joomla conference in Germany later this month. This is a true <strong>community-organized</strong> event, and we feel that as a company, it is <strong>our duty to give back</strong>. That is why we are very proud to announce that <a href="http://jandbeyond.org/sponsors/our-sponsors/item/130-nooku.html">Nooku is an official sponsor of J! And Beyond</a>!</p>

<h3 id="presentations">Presentations</h3>

<p>We’ll be giving two presentations: In his fun warm-up talk “<a href="http://jandbeyond.org/attendees/proposed-talks-and-sessions/item/114.html">Joomla to Infinity and Beyond</a>”, Johan will be shedding new light on the amazing journey that is Joomla.</p>

<p>The next talk is for everybody who ever built a website using Joomla (yes, I know, that’s all of you!). We’ll explain <a href="http://jandbeyond.org/attendees/proposed-talks-and-sessions/item/68-nooku-framework-system-integrators.html">why Nooku Framework matters to you,</a> even if you’re not a developer. Just like the Joomla 1.5 framework caused a wave of innovative extensions, we believe Nooku Framework is going to cause a shift: It changes how you <strong>create and use extension</strong>s, how extensions work <strong>with each other or with external data</strong>, and how you <strong>customize extensions</strong>. We’ll show you some of the promising Nooku-powered extensions that are being built right now.</p>

On the third day, we’re doing an **exclusive three hour **<a href="http://jandbeyond.org/attendees/proposed-talks-and-sessions/item/67-nooku-framework-masterclass.html"><strong>Nooku Framework Workshop</strong></a>. This is your chance to dive into the API that will revolutionize the way you think about code.</p>

<p>Maybe you <strong>still think that plain Joomla is all you’ll ever need</strong>? Can you know for sure without having seen Nooku in action? We invite you to <strong>open your mind</strong> and find out for yourself. If you don’t like Nooku after the first half of the workshop, you’re free to leave. No hard feelings!</p>
