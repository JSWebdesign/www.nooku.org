<p>Nooku Code Jams are fun and informal events. The day starts with the grand tour of the framework. What does it do, what are the concepts and philosophies behind it, etc. Next we show you how to build a small but fully functional MVC component, using only a ridiculously small amount of lines of code.</p>

<p>After lunch, it’s Nooku Workshop time. You get to make your hands dirty ! Depending on your experience with PHP and Joomla, you get to build your own component using what you’ve learned. Or if you’re more experienced you can join the advanced workshop where we dive deep into the Nooku Framework API to learn how to build ultra powerful and extendible extensions.</p>
