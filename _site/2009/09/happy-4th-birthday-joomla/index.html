<p>For us it is it will always be something close to our hearts. Our own Johan Janssens, Peter Russell and Shayne Bartlett were all members of that Mambo Core Team and as such share with sixteen others the unique privilege of being co-founders of Joomla!</p>

<p>As word of Joomla! spread the project attracted a new crop of developers, designers and users, enhancing and extending Joomla! further than had ever been done before. Amongst them a  Belgian developer Mathias Verraes who took it upon himself to make one of the most popular Mambo/Joomla! extensions even better. The extension of course was <a href="http://www.joomladocman.com">DOCman</a>… which had also successfully made the <a href="http://extensions.joomla.org/extensions/directory-a-documentation/downloads/82">transition to Joomla</a>.</p>

<p>Fate, destiny or karma… the sequence of events in the creation of Joomla! lead to the creation of Nooku by Johan and Mathias in 2007. Soon to be joined by Peter and Shayne in 2008.</p>

<p>So it is, that as we celebrate Joomla!’s birthday we also acknowledge the part it has played in our own destiny.</p>

<p>Happy 4th Birthday Joomla!</p>
