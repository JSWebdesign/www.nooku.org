<p>The first <a title="Nooku Demo Day last March" target="_blank" href="en/buzz/86-nooku-demo-day-report.html">Nooku Demo Day last March</a> was a fun gettogether. We got one complaint however: apparently all Joomla events in The Netherlands are in the South of the country. <a href="en/partners.html#jamii" title="Jamii">Jamii</a>, one of our Nooku Partners, decided it was time for a change. They’re inviting colleagues, customers, and friends (and anybody who’s interested) for a second <strong>Dutch Nooku Demo Day on the 16th of October</strong>, all the way up north in <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=slagharen&amp;sll=37.0625,-95.677068&amp;sspn=61.540818,108.720703&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=52.627437,6.55549&amp;spn=0.045639,0.106173&amp;z=14&amp;iwloc=A" title="Slagharen">Slagharen</a>.</p>

<p>We love it when our partners organize events, so of course we happily accepted the invitation to come and show the latest and greatest developments in <a href="en/features.html" title="Nooku Content">Nooku Content</a> (the multilingual extension for Joomla), and <a href="en/framework.html" title="Nooku Framework">Nooku Framework</a> (the rapid application development platform for Joomla).</p>

<!--more-->

<p>Get to know Nooku, the team behind it, and your fellow website developers, all of this in a relaxing atmosphere. We will demonstrate how easy it is to setup multi-lingual websites with Nooku, answers questions, discuss the challenges professionals face and learn from each other.</p>
