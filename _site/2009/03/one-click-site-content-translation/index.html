<p>One of our partners, <a href="http://blog.web-translations.com/">Web Translations</a>, recently announced a <a href="http://blog.web-translations.com/about-translation/multilingual-content-management-can-be-free-and-easy%E2%80%A6/963">cool new service</a> called <a id="oicl" title="Click 4 Translation" href="http://www.click4translation.com/">Click 4 Translation</a>.<br />
Why is this cool? With Joomla + Nooku Content, the technical side of having multi-lingual content was already covered, but now the actual translation gets easier as well. This service tightly integrates with Nooku Content and helps you with the translation into another language (or <a href="http://viavac.com/en/home.html">five</a> or <a href="http://html.knowyourrights2008.org/">eight</a> like some of our Nooku clients’ sites!)</p>

<p>How does it work? Just as always, you publish an article or add content to your website, in your local language. With the click of a button, your content is emailed to translators who will send back the translated files in the required languages of choice.</p>

<p>We think that’s pretty cool: it will help allow customers and readers to have more multi-lingual conversations, just like the real world. <a href="../en/about/contact.html">Let us know</a> if you want to integrate other web services with Nooku Content, so website developers and content managers can make really great websites!</p>
