<p>The Nooku team is delighted to announce that the Nooku Framework has been publicly released — made available at <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/nooku-framework/">Sourceforge.net </a></p>

<p>The framework – which was<a href="en/buzz/95-nooku-framework-the-api-that-speaks-for-itself.html"> announced last May</a> -  empowers Joomla! 1.5 to new levels and is designed to provide third-party developers with <a href="http://blog.rmdstudio.com/2009/05/23/nooku-framework-is-joomlas-missing-mvc-core/">Joomla’s missing MVC</a>.</p>

<p>Lead architect, Johan Janssens, said the framework will provide developers with “future-proof” tools to “enable exciting and efficient ways to make Joomla better through extendable developement.”<br />

<p>For the time being access is only available using <a title="nooku framework subversion code repository" href="https://nooku-framework.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/nooku-framework/" target="_blank">Subversion</a> (SVN). Installable packages will be made available once we hit our 0.7 milestone. There’s a good reason for that: there’s little documentation at the moment, and we don’t want to get flooded by emails from people with support questions. The SVN serves as a simple filter.</p>

<p>So where do you go if you have questions ? Simply fill out the form to <a title="get code access and support for nooku framework" href="en/framework/request.html" target="_blank">request access</a>. It only takes two minutes of your time. It’s a win-win: We get to know a little about you, and you get access to our discussion mailing list, where all the good stuff happens.</p>

<p>… oh, and you get to use the most advanced framework ever built for Joomla.</p>

<p>Nooku Framework is created by award-winning developers and founding members of Joomla who have been responsible for creative innovation in code for many years.</p>
