<p>How time flies … Nooku is <a href="en/buzz/60-website-launch.html" title="title">one year old</a> today! It has been an great year for Nooku with <a href="en/buzz/69-blogger-reviews-nooku-05.html" title="title">great</a> and <a href="en/buzz/77-joomla-seo-expert-praises-nooku.html" title="title">encouraging</a> feedback. Our <a href="en/partners.html" title="title">partner base</a> grew to more then 20 partners in the past year.  Their enthusiasm and commitment shows that a funded GPL model can be a great way to build highly advanced Joomla extensions.</p>

<p>Our <a href="http://blog.joomlatools.eu/2008/02/open-development-approach.html" title="title">agile development methodology</a> has allowed us to release early and often. In the past 12 months we released 2 feature releases and a total of 10 maintenance releases. We counted more than 1500 code commits, closed over 100 tickets and saw a codebase increase of more then 40%. Nooku Content is slowly evolving into a real content manager, and is not just for publishing multi-lingual websites anymore. Mono-lingual websites can benefit from the workflow and <a href="en/buzz/80-nooku-060-released.html" title="title">search engine optimization features</a> Nooku offers as well.</p>

<p>And there is more to come: for the next versions we are focusing on advanced user and translator permissions, article versioning and user interface changes to make your life as a content editor even easier. Our goal is to make Nooku Content the de-facto extension every professional Joomla site should have installed. The coming year we are boosting things up even more, and we’ll be sticking to <a href="en/about/press-releases.html" title="title">our promise</a> of making the technology available to more people.</p>

<p>I would like to take this opportunity to thank all our partners for being so supportive to our project. Without their vision and support we wouldn’t be where we are today: on the verge of a <a href="en/buzz/86-nooku-demo-day-report.html" title="title">Nooku Framework</a> technology explosion. We are extremely excited about the work done in the last 12 months. It’s the tip of the iceberg of what’s to come.</p>
