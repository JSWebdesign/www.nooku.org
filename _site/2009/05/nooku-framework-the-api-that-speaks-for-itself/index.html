<p>With raw coding talent and vision — such as Principal Architect of Joomla 1.5, Johan Janssens, Nooku has been born. And we don’t apologise for keeping Nooku under wraps somewhat, as we believe it is going to create waves of excitement in the joomlasphere. After months of hard work we are revving up all engines as we are sticking to <a href="../en/about/press-releases.html" title="title">our promise</a> of making Nooku technology available to more people.</p>

<p>Initially Nooku was launched as the extension that changed the way people manage multi-lingual websites with Joomla. In reality, there is a lot more below the hood. The true power is in the Nooku Framework that drives it. The framework brings future-proof Web 2.0 development to Joomla.</p>

<p>In effect this ‘wolf-in-sheeps’-clothing’ combines the development speed of Ruby on Rails, the flexibility of Symphony and the power of Zend Framework with the simplicity and usability of Joomla.  We’ve created an API that is so intuitive it speaks for itself; it’s smart enough to interpret, become resuable, extensible and replaceable.  Imagine as a developer being able to achieve all this in a fraction of the lines of code you need today.  Our Nooku Framework delivers this and much more!</p>

<p>The <a class="modal" title="Prezi Presentation : What is the Nooku Framework" rel="{handler: 'iframe', size: {x: 800, y: 600}}" href="http://prezi.com/18701/view/#1">framework</a> can be installed in Joomla as a plugin. It allows developers to build more powerful extensions, or even to develop standalone web applications. One of the first major third party Joomla extensions using the framework is <a href="http://anahitapolis.com/">Anahita Social Engine</a> and of course our Nooku extension itself.</p>
