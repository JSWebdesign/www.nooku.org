The Nooku team is officially announcing the sunset of Nooku Content.</span></p>

<p>With the end of life of Joomla 1.5 coming up at the end of the month and the integrated <a href="http://magazine.joomla.org/issues/Issue-Nov-2011/item/593-Build-a-Multilingual-Site-in-Joomla-1-7">multilingual capabilities that are now available in Joomla 2.5</a>, we feel there is no longer a need for a separate multilingual solution for Joomla.</p>

<p>With the sunset of Nooku Content, we are putting all our focus on growing Nooku as <a href="http://prezi.com/y8xf4syr9yrr/nooku-from-vision-to-architecture/">a free and open source web application platform</a>.</p>

<p>As <a href="http://blog.nooku.org/2012/04/nooku-is-4/">Nooku starts its 5th year,</a> we will slowly leave our Joomla roots behind and wander off into the wider PHP galaxy. Exciting times!</p>

<p>But first, the tool that speaks your language is bidding adieu and we thank all our partners who helped us build Nooku Content.</p>
