        <h3>What is it?</h3>
        <p>Nooku can be installed in <a href="http://www.joomla.org/">Joomla</a> as a plugin and lets you focus on the "business" logic of your extension. By doing most of the repetitive work for you, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boilerplate_code">boilerplate code</a> is eliminated which greatly reduces the time to develop Joomla extensions.</p>
        <p>The design pattern based architecture makes your extension more flexible: your extension becomes more <strong>re-usable</strong>, <strong>replaceable</strong> and more easily <strong>extensible</strong>. Additionally Nooku Framework provides you with excellent out-of-the-box security features.</p>
        <p>Nooku uses a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Component-based_software_engineering">component based architecture</a> and includes everything needed to create Joomla extensions according to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchical_model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller">Hierarchical Model-View-Contoller (HMVC)</a> pattern.</p>

        <h3>Why does it exist?</h3>
        <p>Nooku is built to help developers create <strong>custom</strong> Joomla extensions and tries to solve following problems:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Abstract differences between Joomla versions 2.x and 3.x.</li>
            <li>Provide a solid modern and lean architecture for building extensions.</li>
            <li>Allow extensions to be more flexible and extended easily.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>For who is it?</h3>
        <p>Nooku is for developers creating custom Joomla extensions. The framework can only be installed using <a href="/get-started/">Composer</a>.</p>
        <p>If you are a developer who wishes to distribute the framework as part of an installable package please <a href="/services/">contact us</a> first.</p>
